# Welcome to Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is designed
to become a superset of Python over time.

This repo includes source code for:

- Mojo examples
- Mojo documentation hosted at [modular.com](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/)
- The [Mojo standard library](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/lib)

This repo has two primary branches:

- The [`main`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/main) branch, which is in
sync with the last stable released version of Mojo. Use the examples here if youâ€™re
using a [release build of Mojo](#latest-released).

- The [`nightly`](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/nightly) branch, which
is in sync with the Mojo nightly build and subject to breakage. Use this branch
for [contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md), or if you're using the latest
[nightly build of Mojo](#latest-nightly).

To learn more about Mojo, see the
[Mojo Manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/).

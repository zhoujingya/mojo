This is a running list of significant changes for the Mojo language and tools.
It doesn't include all internal implementation changes.

## Update Mojo

If you don't have Mojo yet, see the [get started
guide](/mojo/manual/get-started/#get-the-mojo-sdk).

To see your Mojo version, run this:

```sh
mojo --version
```

To update Mojo, first [update `modular`](/cli/#description), and then run this:

```sh
modular update mojo
```

## v24.2 (2024-03-28)

### üî• Legendary

- The Mojo standard library is now open source! Check out the
  [README](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/nightly/stdlib/README.md)
  for everything you need to get started.

- Structs and other nominal types are now allowed to implicitly conform to
  traits. A struct implicitly conforms to a trait if it implements all the
  requirements for the trait. For example, any struct that implements the
  `__str__()` method implicitly conforms to `Stringable`, and is usable with
  the `str()` built-in function.

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct Foo:
      fn __str__(self) -> String:
          return "foo!"

  fn main():
      print(str(Foo())) # prints 'foo!'
  ```

  We still strongly encourage you to explicitly list the traits a struct
  conforms to when possible:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct Foo(Stringable): ...
  ```

  Not only is this useful for documentation and for communicating intentions,
  but in the future, explicit conformance will be useful for features like
  default methods and extensions.

- Mojo's Python interoperability now supports passing keyword arguments to
  Python functions:

  ```mojo
  from python import Python

  def main():
      plt = Python.import_module("matplotlib.pyplot")
      plt.plot((5, 10), (10, 15), color="red")
      plt.show()
  ```

### Language changes

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Mojo now has support for variadic keyword arguments, often referred to as
  `**kwargs`. This means you can now declare and call functions like this:

  ```mojo
  fn print_nicely(**kwargs: Int) raises:
    for key in kwargs.keys():
        print(key[], "=", kwargs[key[]])

   # prints:
   # `a = 7`
   # `y = 8`
  print_nicely(a=7, y=8)
  ```

  There are currently a few limitations:

  - The ownership semantics of variadic keyword arguments are always `owned`.
    This is applied implicitly, and cannot be declared otherwise:

    ```mojo
    # Not supported yet.
    fn borrowed_var_kwargs(borrowed **kwargs: Int): ...
    ```

  - Functions with variadic keyword arguments cannot have default values for
    keyword-only arguments. For example:

    ```mojo
    # Not allowed yet, because `b` is keyword-only with a default.
    fn not_yet(*, b: Int = 9, **kwargs: Int): ...

    # Okay, because `c` is positional-or-keyword, so it can have a default.
    fn still_works(c: Int = 5, **kwargs: Int): ...
    ```

  - Dictionary unpacking is not supported yet:

    ```mojo
    fn takes_dict(d: Dict[String, Int]):
      print_nicely(**d)  # Not supported yet.
    ```

  - Variadic keyword _parameters_ are not supported yet:

    ```mojo
    # Not supported yet.
    fn var_kwparams[**kwparams: Int](): ...
    ```

#### ü¶ã Changed or removed

- `let` declarations now produce a compile time error instead of a warning,
  our next step in [removing let
  declarations](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/proposals/remove-let-decls.md).
  The compiler still recognizes the `let` keyword for now in order to produce
  a good error message, but that will be removed in subsequent releases.

- Mojo now warns about unused values in both `def` and `fn` declarations,
  instead of completely disabling the warning in `def`s.  It never warns about
  unused `object` or `PythonObject` values, tying the warning to these types
  instead of the kind of function they are unused in.  This will help catch API
  usage bugs in `def`s and make imported Python APIs more ergonomic in `fn`s.

- For the time being, dynamic type values will be disabled in the language. For
  example, the following will now fail with an error:

  ```mojo
  var t = Int  # dynamic type values not allowed

  struct SomeType: ...

  takes_type(SomeType)  # dynamic type values not allowed
  ```

  We want to take a step back and (re)design type valued variables,
  existentials, and other dynamic features. This does not affect type valued
  **parameters**, so the following works as before:

  ```mojo
  alias t = Int  # still üî•

  struct SomeType: ...

  takes_type[SomeType]()  # already üî•

  >fn uses_trait[T: SomeTrait](value: T): ... # still üî•
  ```

- The `*_` expression in parameter expressions is now required to occur at the
  end of a positional parameter list, instead of being allowed in the middle.

  ```mojo
  # No longer supported
  alias FirstUnbound = SomeStruct[*_, 42]
  alias MidUnbound   = SomeStruct[7, *_, 6]
  # Still supported
  alias LastUnbound  = SomeStruct[42, *_]
  ```

  We narrowed this because we want to encourage type designers
  to get the order of parameters right, and want to extend `*_` to support
  keyword parameters as well in the future.

### Standard library changes

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- `DynamicVector` has been renamed to
  [`List`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list.html#list), and has moved from the
  `collections.vector` module to the `collections.list` module. In addition:

  - You can now construct a `List` from a variadic number of values. For
    example:

    ```mojo
    var numbers = List[Int](1, 2, 3)
    ```

  - `List` and
    [`InlinedFixedVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/vector.html#inlinedfixedvector)
    types now support negative indexing. This means that you can write `vec[-1]`
    which is equivalent to `vec[len(vec)-1]`.

  - `List.push_back()` has been removed.  Please use the `append()` function
    instead.

- The [`print()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/io#print) function now takes `sep` and
  `end` keyword arguments. This means that you can write:

  ```mojo
  print("Hello", "Mojo", sep=", ", end="!!!\n") # prints Hello, Mojo!!!
  ```

  `sep` defaults to the empty string and `end` defaults to "\n".

  Also, the `print_no_newline()` function has been removed.  Please use
  `print(end="")` instead.

- The [`FloatLiteral`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/float_literal#floatliteral) type is
  now an infinite-precision nonmaterializable type. This means you can do
  compile-time calculations using `FloatLiteral` without rounding errors. When
  materialized at runtime, a `FloatLiteral` value is converted to a
  [`Float64`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd).

  ```mojo
  # third is an infinite-precision FloatLiteral value
  alias third = 1.0 / 3.0
  # t is a Float64
  var t = third
  ```

- String types all conform to the
  [`IntableRaising`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int#intableraising) trait. This means
  that you can now call `int("123")` to get the integer `123`. If the integer
  cannot be parsed from the string, then an error is raised.

- The `Tensor` type now has [`argmax()`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor#argmax) and
  [`argmin()`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor#argmin) functions to compute the
  position of the max or min value.

- Added a new
  [`collections.OptionalReg`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/optional#optionalreg)
  type, a register-passable alternative to
  [`Optional`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/optional#optional).

- The [`ulp()`](/mojo/stdlib/math/math#ulp) function has been added to the
  `math` module. This allows you to get the units of least precision (or units
  of last place) of a floating point value.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The
  [`EqualityComparable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/equality_comparable#equalitycomparable)
  trait now requires the `__ne__()` method for conformance in addition to the
  previously required `__eq__()` method.

- Many types now declare conformance to `EqualityComparable` trait.

- [`StaticTuple`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/static_tuple#statictuple) parameter order
  has changed to `StaticTuple[type, size]` for consistency with `SIMD` and
  similar collection types.

- The signature of the
  [`elementwise()`](/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/functional#elementwise) function has
  been changed. The new order is is `function`, `simd_width`, and then `rank`.
  As a result, the rank parameter can now be inferred and one can call
  `elementwise()` without it:

  ```mojo
  elementwise[func, simd_width](shape)
  ```

- `PythonObject` is now register-passable.

- `PythonObject.__iter__()` now works correctly on more types of iterable Python
  objects. Attempting to iterate over non-iterable objects will now raise an
  exception instead of behaving as if iterating over an empty sequence.
  `__iter__()` also now borrows `self` rather than requiring `inout`, allowing
  code like:

  ```mojo
  for value in my_dict.values():
    ...
  ```

#### üöö Moved

- We took the opportunity to rehome some modules into their correct package
  as we were going through the process of open-sourcing the Mojo standard
  library.  Specifically, the following are some breaking changes worth
  calling out.  Please update your import statements accordingly.

  - [`Buffer`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/buffer#buffer),
    [`NDBuffer`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/buffer#ndbuffer), and friends have moved
    from the `memory` package into a new `buffer` package.

    ```mojo
    from buffer import Buffer, NDBuffer
    ```

  - `utils.list`, including the [`Dim`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/list#dim) and
    [`DimList`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/list#dimlist) types, has moved to
    the `buffer` package.

    ```mojo
    from buffer import Dim, DimList
    ```

  - The [`parallel_memcpy()`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/memory#parallel_memcpy)
    function has moved from the `memory` package into the `buffer` package.

    ```mojo
    from buffer import parallel_memcpy
    ```

  - The [`rand()`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/random#rand) and
    [`randn()`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/random#randn) functions from the `random`
    package that return a `Tensor` have moved to the `tensor` package. Note that
    the overloads that write to a `DTypePointer` remain in the `random` package.

    If you happen to be using both versions in the same source file, you can
    import them both using the `import as` syntax:

    ```mojo
    from tensor import rand
    from random import rand as rand_dt
    ```

  - The `trap()` function has been renamed to
    [`abort()`](/mojo/stdlib/os/os#abort).  It also has moved from the `debug`
    module to the `os` module.

    ```mojo
    from os import abort
    ```

  - The [`isinf()`](/mojo/stdlib/math/math#isinf) and
    [`isfinite()`](/mojo/stdlib/math/math#isfinite) methods have been moved from
    `math.limits` to the `math` module.

    ```mojo
    from math import ininf, isfinite
    ```

### Tooling changes

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Docstring code blocks can now use `%#` to hide lines of code from
  documentation generation.

  For example:

  ```mojo
  var value = 5
  %# print(value)
  ```

  Will generate documentation of the form:

  ```mojo
  var value = 5
  ```

  Hidden lines are processed as if they were normal code lines during test
  execution. This allows for writing additional code within a docstring
  example that is only used to ensure the example is runnable/testable.

- The Mojo LSP server now allow you to specify additional search paths to use
  when resolving imported modules in a document. You can specify search paths
  on the command line, using the `-I` option, or you can add them to the
  `mojo.lsp.includeDirs` setting in the VS Code extension.

### ‚ùå Removed

- The `__get_address_as_lvalue` magic function has been removed.  You can now
  get an LValue from a `Pointer` or `Reference` by using the dereference
  operator (`[]`):

  ```mojo
  var ptr: Pointer[MyRecord]
  ...
  # Doesn't work
  __get_address_as_lvalue(ptr.value) = MyRecord(3, 5)
  # Works
  ptr[] = MyRecord(3, 5)
  ```

- The type parameter for the `memcpy` function is now automatically inferred.
  This means that calls to `memcpy` of the form `memcpy[Dtype.xyz](...)` will
  no longer work and the user would have to change the code to `memcpy(...)`.

- The [`memcpy()`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/memory#memcpy) overload that worked on
  [`Buffer`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/buffer#buffer) types has been removed in favor
  of just overloads for [`Pointer`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#pointer) and
  [`DTypePointer`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#dtypepointer):

  ```mojo
  # Doesn't work
  memcpy(destBuffer, srcBuffer, count)
  # Works
  memcpy(destBuffer.data, srcBuffer.data, count)
  ```

- The functions `max_or_inf()`, `min_or_neginf()` have been removed from
  `math.limit`. These functions were only used by the SIMD type.

- As mentioned previously, the `print_no_newline()` function has been removed.
  Please use `print(end="")` instead.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

  binding Reference to lvalue with subtype lifetime.
- [#1945](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1945) - `Optional[T].or_else()`
  should return `T` instead of `Optional[T]`.
- [#1940](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1940) - Constrain `math.copysign`
  to floating point or integral types.
- [#1838](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1838) - Variadic `print`
  does not work when specifying `end=""`
- [#1826](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1826) - The `SIMD.reduce` methods
  correctly handle edge cases where `size_out >= size`.

## v24.1.1 (2024-03-18)

This release includes installer improvements and enhanced error reporting for
installation issues. Otherwise it is functionally identical to Mojo 24.1.

## v24.1 (2024-02-29)

### üî• Legendary

- Mojo is now bundled with [the MAX platform](/max)!

  As such, the Mojo package version now matches the MAX version, which follows
  a `YY.MAJOR.MINOR` version scheme. Because this is our first release in 2024,
  that makes this version `24.1`.

- Mojo debugging support is here! The Mojo VS Code extension includes debugger
  support. For details, see [Debugging](/mojo/tools/debugging) in the Mojo
  Manual.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- We now have a [`Set`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/set.html#set) type in our
  collections! `Set` is backed by a `Dict`, so it has fast add, remove, and `in`
  checks, and requires member elements to conform to the `KeyElement` trait.

  ```mojo
  from collections import Set

  var set = Set[Int](1, 2, 3)
  print(len(set))  # 3
  set.add(4)

  for element in set:
      print(element[])

  set -= Set[Int](3, 4, 5)
  print(set == Set[Int](1, 2))  # True
  print(set | Set[Int](0, 1) == Set[Int](0, 1, 2))  # True
  let element = set.pop()
  print(len(set))  # 1
  ```

- Mojo now supports the `x in y` expression as syntax sugar for
  `y.__contains__(x)` as well as `x not in y`.

- Mojo now has support for keyword-only arguments and parameters. For example:

  ```mojo
  fn my_product(a: Int, b: Int = 1, *, c: Int, d: Int = 2):
      print(a * b * c * d)

  my_product(3, c=5)     # prints '30'
  my_product(3, 5, d=7)  # error: missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'c'
  ```

  This includes support for declaring signatures that use both variadic and
  keyword-only arguments/parameters. For example, the following is now possible:

  ```mojo
  fn prod_with_offset(*args: Int, offset: Int = 0) -> Int:
      var res = 1
      for i in range(len(args)):
          res *= args[i]
      return res + offset

  print(prod_with_offset(2, 3, 4, 10))         # prints 240
  print(prod_with_offset(2, 3, 4, offset=10))  # prints 34
  ```

  Note that variadic keyword-only arguments/parameters (for example, `**kwargs`)
  are not supported yet. That is, the following is not allowed:

  ```mojo
  fn variadic_kw_only(a: Int, **kwargs): ...
  ```

  For more information, see
  [Positional-only and keyword-only arguments](/mojo/manual/functions#positional-only-and-keyword-only-arguments)
  in the Mojo Manual.

- The `print()` function now accepts a keyword-only argument for the `end`
  which is useful for controlling whether a newline is printed or not
  after printing the elements.  By default, `end` defaults to "\n" as before.

- The Mojo SDK can now be installed on AWS Graviton instances.

- A new version of the [Mojo Playground](/mojo/playground) is available. The new
  playground is a simple interactive editor for Mojo code, similar to the Rust
  Playground or Go Playground. The old
  [JupyterLab based playground](https://playground.modular.com) will remain
  online until March 20th.

- The Mojo LSP server will now generate fixits for populating empty
  documentation strings:

  ```mojo
  fn foo(arg: Int):
      """""" # Unexpected empty documentation string
  ```

  Applying the fixit from above will generate:

  ```mojo
  fn foo(arg: Int):
      """[summary].

      Args:
          arg: [description].
      """
  ```

- Added new `*_` syntax that allows users to explicitly unbind any number of
  positional parameters. For example:

  ```mojo
  struct StructWithDefault[a: Int, b: Int, c: Int = 8, d: Int = 9]: pass

  alias all_unbound = StructWithDefault[*_]
  # equivalent to
  alias all_unbound = StructWithDefault[_, _, _, _]

  alias first_bound = StructWithDefault[5, *_]
  # equivalent to
  alias first_bound = StructWithDefault[5, _, _, _]

  alias last_bound = StructWithDefault[*_, 6]
  # equivalent to
  alias last_bound = StructWithDefault[_, _, _, 6]

  alias mid_unbound = StructWithDefault[3, *_, 4]
  # equivalent to
  alias mid_unbound = StructWithDefault[3, _, _, 4]
  ```

  As demonstrated above, this syntax can be used to explicitly unbind an
  arbitrary number of parameters, at the beginning, at the end, or in the
  middle of the operand list. Since these unbound parameters must be explicitly
  specified at some point, default values for these parameters are not applied.
  For example:

  ```mojo
  alias last_bound = StructWithDefault[*_, 6]
  # When using last_bound, you must specify a, b, and c. last_bound
  # doesn't have a default value for `c`.
  var s = last_bound[1, 2, 3]()
  ```

  For more information see the Mojo Manual sections on
  [partially-bound types](/mojo/manual/parameters/#fully-bound-partially-bound-and-unbound-types)
  and
  [automatic parameterization of functions](/mojo/manual/parameters/#automatic-parameterization-of-functions).

- [`DynamicVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list#list) now
  supports iteration. Iteration values are instances of
  [Reference](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#reference) and require dereferencing:

  ```mojo
  var v: DynamicVector[String]()
  v.append("Alice")
  v.append("Bob")
  v.append("Charlie")
  for x in v:
      x[] = str("Hello, ") + x[]
  for x in v:
      print(x[])
  ```

- `DynamicVector` now has
  [`reverse()`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/vector.html#reverse) and
  [`extend()`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/vector.html#extend) methods.

- The `mojo package` command now produces compilation agnostic packages.
  Compilation options such as O0, or --debug-level, are no longer needed or
  accepted. As a result, packages are now smaller, and extremely portable.

- Initializers for `@register_passable` values can (and should!) now be
  specified with `inout self` arguments just like memory-only types:

  ```mojo
  @register_passable
  struct YourPair:
      var a: Int
      var b: Int
      fn __init__(inout self):
          self.a = 42
          self.b = 17
      fn __copyinit__(inout self, existing: Self):
          self.a = existing.a
          self.b = existing.b
  ```

  This form makes the language more consistent, more similar to Python, and
  easier to implement advanced features for.  There is also no performance
  impact of using this new form: the compiler arranges to automatically return
  the value in a register without requiring you to worry about it.

  The older `-> Self` syntax is still supported in this release, but will be
  removed in a subsequent one, so please migrate your code.  One thing to watch
  out for: a given struct should use one style or the other, mixing some of
  each won't work well.

- The standard library `slice` type has been renamed to
  [`Slice`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_slice#slice), and a `slice`
  function has been introduced.  This makes Mojo closer to Python and makes the
  `Slice` type follow the naming conventions of other types like `Int`.

- "Slice" syntax in subscripts is no longer hard coded to the builtin `slice`
  type: it now works with any type accepted by a container's `__getitem__()`
  method. For example:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct UnusualSlice:
      var a: Int
      var b: Float64
      var c: String

  struct YourContainer:
      fn __getitem__(self, slice: UnusualSlice) -> T: ...
  ```

  Given this implementation, you can subscript into an instance of
  `YourContainer` like `yc[42:3.14:"üî•"]` and the three values are passed to the
  `UnusualSlice` constructor.

- The `__refitem__()` accessor method may now return a
  [`Reference`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#reference) instead of having to
  return an MLIR internal reference type.

- Added [`AnyPointer.move_into()`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/anypointer.html#move_into)
  method, for moving a value from one pointer memory location to another.

- Added built-in [`hex()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/hex#hex) function, which can be
  used to format any value whose type implements the
  [`Intable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int#intable) trait as a hexadecimal string.

- [`PythonObject`](/mojo/stdlib/python/object#pythonobject) now implements
  `__is__` and `__isnot__` so that you can use expressions of the form `x is y`
  and `x is not y` with `PythonObject`.

- [`PythonObject`](/mojo/stdlib/python/object#pythonobject) now conforms to the
  `SizedRaising` trait. This means the built-in
  [`len()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/len#len) function now works on `PythonObject`.

- The `os` package now contains the [`stat()`](/mojo/stdlib/os/fstat#stat)
  and [`lstat()`](/mojo/stdlib/os/fstat#lstat) functions.

- A new [`os.path`](/mojo/stdlib/os/path/path) package now allows you to query
  properties on paths.

- The `os` package now has a
  [`PathLike`](/mojo/stdlib/os/pathlike.html#pathlike) trait. A struct conforms
  to the `PathLike` trait by implementing the `__fspath__()` function.

- The [`pathlib.Path`](/mojo/stdlib/pathlib/path#path) now has functions to
  query properties of the path.

- The [`listdir()`](/mojo/stdlib/pathlib/path#listdir) method now exists on
  [`pathlib.Path`](/mojo/stdlib/pathlib/path) and also exists in the `os`
  module to work on `PathLike` structs. For example, the following sample
  lists all the directories in the `/tmp` directory:

  ```mojo
  from pathlib import Path

  fn walktree(top: Path, inout files: DynamicVector[Path]):
      try:
          var ls = top.listdir()
          for i in range(len(ls)):
              var child = top / ls[i]
              if child.is_dir():
                  walktree(child, files)
              elif child.is_file():
                  files.append(child)
              else:
                  print("Skipping '" + str(child) + "'")
      except:
          return

  fn main():
      var files = DynamicVector[Path]()

      walktree(Path("/tmp"), files)

      for i in range(len(files)):
          print(files[i])
  ```

- The [`find()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string_literal#find),
  [`rfind()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string_literal#rfind),
  [`count()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string_literal#count), and
  [`__contains__()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string_literal#__contains__) methods
  now work on string literals. This means that you can write:

  ```mojo
  if "Mojo" in "Hello Mojo":
      ...
  ```

- Breakpoints can now be inserted programmatically within the code using the
  builtin [`breakpoint()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/breakpoint#breakpoint) function.

  Note: on Graviton instances, the debugger might not be able to resume after
  hitting this kind of breakpoint.

- Added a builtin [`Boolable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/bool#boolable) trait that
  describes a type that can be represented as a boolean value. To conform to the
  trait, a type must implement the `__bool__()` method.

- Modules within packages can now use purely relative `from` imports:

  ```mojo
  from . import another_module
  ```

- Trivial types, like MLIR types and function types, can now be bound implicitly
  to traits that require copy constructors or move constructors, such as
  [`Movable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value.html#movable),
  [`Copyable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value.html#copyable), and
  [`CollectionElement`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value#collectionelement).

- A new magic `__lifetime_of(expr)` call will yield the lifetime of a memory
  value.  We hope and expect that this will eventually be replaced by
  `Reference(expr).lifetime` as the parameter system evolves, but this is
  important in the meantime for use in function signatures.

- A new magic `__type_of(expr)` call will yield the type of a value. This allows
  one to refer to types of other variables. For example:

  ```mojo
  fn my_function(x: Int, y: __type_of(x)) -> Int:
      let z: __type_of(x) = y
      return z
  ```

### ü¶ã Changed

- As another step towards [removing let
  declarations](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/proposals/remove-let-decls.md)
  we have removed support for let declarations inside the compiler.  To ease
  migration, we parse `let` declarations as a `var` declaration so your code
  won't break.  We emit a warning about this, but please switch your code to
  using `var` explicitly, because this migration support will be removed in a
  subsequent update.

  ```mojo
  fn test():
      # treated as a var, but please update your code!
      let x = 42  # warning: 'let' is being removed, please use 'var' instead
      x = 9
  ```

- It is no longer possible to explicitly specify implicit argument parameters in
  [automatically parameterized
  functions](/mojo/manual/parameters/#automatic-parameterization-of-functions)).
  This ability was an oversight and this is now an error:

  ```mojo
  fn autoparameterized(x: SIMD):
      pass

  autoparameterized[DType.int32, 1](3) # error: too many parameters
  ```

- `vectorize_unroll` has been removed, and
  [`vectorize`](/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/functional#vectorize) now has a parameter
  named `unroll_factor` with a default value of 1. Increasing `unroll_factor`
  may improve performance at the cost of binary size. See the
  [loop unrolling blog here](https://www.modular.com/blog/what-is-loop-unrolling-how-you-can-speed-up-mojo)
  for more details.

- The `vectorize` signatures have changed with the closure `func` moved to the
  first parameter:

  ```mojo
  vectorize[func, width, unroll_factor = 1](size)
  vectorize[func, width, size, unroll_factor = 1]()
  ```

  The doc string has been updated with examples demonstrating the difference
  between the two signatures.

- The `unroll` signatures have changed with the closure `func` moved to the
  first parameter:

  ```mojo
  unroll[func, unroll_count]()
  ```

- The signature of the [`NDBuffer`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/buffer#ndbuffer) and
  [`Buffer`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/buffer#buffer) types have changed. Now, both
  take the type as the first parameter and no longer require the shape
  parameter. This allows you to use these types and have sensible defaults.
  For example:

  ```mojo
  NDBuffer[DType.float32, 3]
  ```

  is equivalent to

  ```mojo
  NDBuffer[DType.float32, 3, DimList.create_unknown[3]()]
  ```

  Users can still specify the static shape (if known) to the type:

  ```mojo
  NDBuffer[DType.float32, 3, DimList(128, 128, 3)]
  ```

- The error message for missing function arguments is improved: instead of
  describing the number of arguments (e.g. `callee expects at least 3 arguments,
  but 1 was specified`) the missing arguments are now described by
  name (e.g. `missing 2 required positional arguments: 'b', 'c'`).

- The [`CollectionElement`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value#collectionelement) trait
  is now a built-in trait and has been removed from `collections.vector`.

- The `DynamicVector(capacity: Int)` constructor has been changed to take
  `capacity` as a keyword-only argument to prevent implicit conversion from
  `Int`.

- [`Variant.get[T]()`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/variant#get) now returns a
  [`Reference`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#reference) to the value rather than a
  copy.

- The [`String`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#string) methods `tolower()`
  and `toupper()` have been renamed to `str.lower()` and `str.upper()`.

- The `ref` and `mutref` identifiers are no longer reserved as Mojo keywords.
  We originally thought about using those as language sugar for references, but
  we believe that generic language features combined with the
  [`Reference`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#reference) type will provide a good
  experience without dedicated sugar.

## v0.7.0 (2024-01-25)

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- A new Mojo-native dictionary type,
  [`Dict`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/dict.html) for storing key-value pairs.
  `Dict` stores values that conform to the
  [`CollectionElement`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value#collectionelement)
  trait. Keys need to conform to the new
  [`KeyElement`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/dict.html#keyelement) trait, which is
  not yet implemented by other standard library types. In the short term, you
  can create your own wrapper types to use as keys. For example, the following
  sample defines a `StringKey` type and uses it to create a dictionary that maps
  strings to `Int` values:

  ```mojo
  from collections.dict import Dict, KeyElement

  @value
  struct StringKey(KeyElement):
      var s: String

      fn __init__(inout self, owned s: String):
          self.s = s ^

      fn __init__(inout self, s: StringLiteral):
          self.s = String(s)

      fn __hash__(self) -> Int:
          return hash(self.s)

      fn __eq__(self, other: Self) -> Bool:
          return self.s == other.s

  fn main() raises:
      var d = Dict[StringKey, Int]()
      d["cats"] = 1
      d["dogs"] = 2
      print(len(d))         # prints 2
      print(d["cats"])      # prints 1
      print(d.pop("dogs"))  # prints 2
      print(len(d))         # prints 1
  ```

  We plan to add `KeyElement` conformance to standard library types in
  subsequent releases.

- Users can opt-in to assertions used in the standard library code by
  specifying `-D MOJO_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS` when invoking `mojo` to
  compile your source file(s).  In the case that an assertion is fired,
  the assertion message will be printed along with the stack trace
  before the program exits.  By default, assertions are _not enabled_
  in the standard library right now for performance reasons.

- The Mojo Language Server now implements the References request. IDEs use
  this to provide support for **Go to References** and **Find All References**.
  A current limitation is that references outside of the current document are
  not supported, which will be addressed in the future.

- The [`sys.info`](/mojo/stdlib/sys/info) module now includes
  `num_physical_cores()`, `num_logical_cores()`, and `num_performance_cores()`
  functions.

- Homogenous variadic arguments consisting of memory-only types, such as
  `String` are more powerful and easier to use. These arguments are projected
  into a
  [`VariadicListMem`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list.html#variadiclistmem).

  (Previous releases made it easier to use variadic lists of register-passable
  types, like `Int`.)

  Subscripting into a `VariadicListMem` now returns the element instead of an
  obscure internal type. In addition, we now support `inout` and `owned`
  variadic arguments:

  ```mojo
  fn make_worldly(inout *strs: String):
      # This "just works" as you'd expect!
      for i in range(len(strs)):
          strs[i] += " world"
  fn main():
      var s1: String = "hello"
      var s2: String = "konnichiwa"
      var s3: String = "bonjour"
      make_worldly(s1, s2, s3)
      print(s1)  # hello world
      print(s2)  # konnichiwa world
      print(s3)  # bonjour world
  ```

  (Previous releases made it easier to use variadic lists, but subscripting into
  a `VariadicListMem` returned a low-level pointer, which required the user to
  call `__get_address_as_lvalue()` to access the element.)

  Note that subscripting the variadic list works nicely as above, but
  iterating over the variadic list directly with a `for` loop produces a
  [`Reference`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#reference) (described below) instead
  of the desired value, so an extra subscript is required; We intend to fix this
  in the future.

  ```mojo
  fn make_worldly(inout *strs: String):
      # Requires extra [] to dereference the reference for now.
      for i in strs:
          i[] += " world"
  ```

  Heterogenous variadic arguments have not yet been moved to the new model, but
  will in future updates.

  Note that for variadic arguments of register-passable types like `Int`, the
  variadic list contains values, not references, so the dereference operator
  (`[]`) is not required. This code continues to work as it did previously:

  ```mojo
  fn print_ints(*nums: Int):
      for num in nums:
          print(num)
      print(len(nums))
  ```

- Mojo now has a prototype version of a safe
  [`Reference`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe#reference) type. The compiler's
  lifetime tracking pass can reason about references to safely extend local
  variable lifetime, and check indirect access safety.  The `Reference` type
  is brand new (and currently has no syntactic sugar) so it must be explicitly
  dereferenced with an empty subscript: `ref[]` provides access to the
  underlying value.

  ```mojo
  fn main():
      var a: String = "hello"
      var b: String = " references"

      var aref = Reference(a)
      aref[] += b
      print(a)  # prints "hello references"

      aref[] += b
      # ^last use of b, it is destroyed here.

      print(aref[]) # prints "hello references references"
      # ^last use of a, it is destroyed here.
  ```

  While the `Reference` type has the same in-memory representation as a C
  pointer or the Mojo `Pointer` type, it also tracks a symbolic "lifetime" value
  so the compiler can reason about the potentially accessed set of values.  This
  lifetime is part of the static type of the reference, so it propagates through
  generic algorithms and abstractions built around it.

  The `Reference` type can form references to both mutable and immutable memory
  objects, e.g. those on the stack or borrowed/inout/owned function arguments.
  It is fully parametric over mutability, eliminating the [problems with code
  duplication due to mutability
  specifiers](https://duckki.github.io/2024/01/01/inferred-mutability.html) and
  provides the base for unified user-level types. For example, it could be
  used to implement an array slice object that handles both mutable and immutable
  array slices.

  While this is a major step forward for the lifetimes system in Mojo, it is
  still _very_ early and awkward to use.  Notably, there is no syntactic sugar
  for using references, such as automatic dereferencing. Several aspects of it
  need to be more baked. It is getting exercised by variadic memory arguments,
  which is why they are starting to behave better now.

  Note: the safe `Reference` type and the unsafe pointer types are defined in
  the same module, currently named `memory.unsafe`. We expect to restructure
  this module in a future release.

- Mojo now allows types to implement `__refattr__()` and `__refitem__()` to
  enable attribute and subscript syntax with computed accessors that return
  references. For common situations where these address a value in memory this
  provides a more convenient and significantly more performant alternative to
  implementing the traditional get/set pairs.  Note: this may be changed in the
  future when references auto-dereference‚Äîat that point we may switch to just
  returning a reference from `__getattr__()`.
- Parametric closures can now capture register passable typed values by copy
  using the `__copy_capture` decorator. For example, the following code will
  print `5`, not `2`.

  ```mojo
  fn foo(x: Int):
      var z = x

      @__copy_capture(z)
      @parameter
      fn formatter() -> Int:
          return z
      z = 2
      print(formatter())

  fn main():
      foo(5)
  ```

- String now implements KeyElement and may be used as a key in Dict.
- More robust support for structs with fields of self referencing types.
  For example, the following code will work and print `0`:

  ```mojo
  struct Foo(CollectionElement):
      var vec: DynamicVector[Self]

      fn __init__(inout self: Self):
          self.vec = DynamicVector[Self]()

      fn __moveinit__(inout self: Self, owned existing: Self):
          self.vec = existing.vec ^

      fn __copyinit__(inout self: Self, existing: Self):
          self.vec = existing.vec


  fn main():
      var foo = Foo()
      print(len(foo.vec))
  ```

### ‚ùå Removed

- The `__takeinit__` special constructor form has been removed from the
  language.  This "non-destructive move" operation was previously wired into the
  `x^` transfer operator, but had unpredictable behavior that wasn't consistent.
  Now that Mojo has traits, it is better to model this as an explicit `.take()`
  operation on a type, which would transfer out the contents of the type without
  ending its lifetime. For example, for a type that holds a pointer, `take()`
  might return a new instance pointing to the same data, and null out its own
  internal pointer.

  This change makes it clear when a lifetime is ended versus when the
  contents of an LValue are explicitly taken.

- The current implementation of autotuning has been deprecated, as Mojo's
  autotuning implementation is undergoing a redesign. Tutorials around the
  current implementation have also been removed as they are being rewritten.

  Consequently, the `autotune()`, `autotune_fork()`, and `search()` functions
  have been removed from the standard library.

- The `_OldDynamicVector` type that worked only on register passable element
  types has been removed.  Please migrate uses to
  [`DynamicVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list#list) which
  works on both register passable and memory types.

- The `UnsafeFixedVector` in `utils.vector` has been removed. We recommend using
  either [`DynamicVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list#list)
  or [`InlinedFixedVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/vector.html#inlinedfixedvector)
  instead.

- The `@adaptive` decorator has been removed from the language. Any uses of the
  decorator in a non-search context can be replaced with `@parameter if`. For
  example:

  ```mojo
  @adaptive
  fn foo[a: Bool]():
      constrained[a]()
      body1()

  @adaptive
  fn foo[a: Bool]():
      constrained[not a]()
      body2()
  ```

  Can be rewritten as:

  ```mojo
  fn foo[a: Bool]():
      @parameter
      if a:
          body1()
      else:
          body2()
  ```

  Consequently, the special `__adaptive_set` attribute has been removed as well.

- Result parameters have been removed from Mojo. Result parameter declarations
  in function parameter lists are no longer allowed, nor are forward alias
  declarations. This includes removing the `param_return` statement.

- The `@noncapturing` and `@closure` decorators have been removed due to
  refinements and improvements to the closure model. See below for more details!

### ü¶ã Changed

- The Mojo closure model has been refined to be more straightforward and safe.
  Mojo has two closure types: parameter closures and runtime closures. Parameter
  closures can be used in higher-order functions and are the backbone of
  functions like `vectorize` and `parallelize`. They are always denoted by
  `@parameter` and have type `fn() capturing -> T` (where `T` is the return
  type).

  On the other hand, runtime closures are always dynamic values, capture values
  by invoking their copy constructor, and retain ownership of their capture
  state. You can define a runtime closure by writing a nested function that
  captures values:

  ```mojo
  fn outer(b: Bool, x: String) -> fn() escaping -> None:
      fn closure():
          print(x) # 'x' is captured by calling String.__copyinit__

      fn bare_function():
          print("hello") # nothing is captured

      if b:
          # closure can be safely returned because it owns its state
          return closure^

      # function pointers can be converted to runtime closures
      return bare_function
  ```

  The type of runtime closures are of the form `fn() escaping -> T`. You
  can pass equivalent function pointers as runtime closures.

  Stay tuned for capture list syntax for move capture and capture by reference,
  and a more unified closure model!

- The `@unroll(n)` decorator can now take a parameter expression for
  the unroll factor, i.e. `n` can be a parameter expression that is
  of integer type.

- The `cpython` module in the `python` package has been moved to be an internal
  module, i.e, `_cpython`.

- `AnyType` and `Destructable` have been unified into a single trait, `AnyType`.
  Every nominal type (i.e. all structs) now automatically conform to `AnyType`.

- Previously, the `mojo package` command would output a Mojo package that
  included both partly-compiled Mojo code, as well as fully-compiled machine
  code for a specific computer architecture -- the architecture of the machine
  being used to invoke the `mojo package` command.

  Now, `mojo package` only includes partly-compiled Mojo code. It is only fully
  compiled for the specific computer architecture being used at the point that
  the package is first `import`-ed. As a result, Mojo packages are smaller and
  more portable.

- The `simd_width` and `dtype` parameters of `polynomial_evaluate` have been
  switched. Based on the request in
  [#1587](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1587), the
  `polynomial_evaluate` function has also been extended so that the
  `coefficients` parameter can take either a either a
  [`StaticTuple`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/static_tuple#statictuple) or a
  [`VariadicList`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list#variadiclist).

- As a tiny step towards removing `let` declarations, this release removes the
  warning: `'var' was never mutated, consider switching to a 'let'`.

## v0.6.1 (2023-12-18)

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- The Mojo REPL now provides limited support for the `%cd` magic command.

  This command automatically maintains an internal stack of directories you
  visit during the REPL session. Usage:

  - `%cd 'dir'`: change to directory `dir` and push it on the directory stack.
  - `%cd -`: pop the directory stack and change to the last visited directory.

- Structs decorated with `@value` now automatically conform to the
  [`Movable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value.html#movable)
  and [`Copyable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value.html#copyable) built-in traits.

- [`String`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#string) now has new
  [`toupper()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#toupper) and
  [`tolower()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#tolower) methods analogous,
  respectively, to Python's `str.toupper()` and `str.tolower()`.

- Added a [`hash()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/hash.html#hash) built-in function and
  [`Hashable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/hash.html#Hashable) trait for types
  implementing the `__hash__()` method. Future releases will add `Hashable`
  support to Standard Library types. In the meantime, the `hash` module includes
  a version of the `hash()` function that works on arbitrary byte strings. To
  generate hashes for [`SIMD`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd.html#simd) types, you
  use the internal `_hash_simd()` function:

  ```mojo
  from builtin.hash import _hash_simd

  fn gen_simd_hash():
      let vector = SIMD[DType.int64, 4](1, 2, 3, 4)
      let hash = _hash_simd(vector)
  ```

- Several standard library types now conform to the
  [`CollectionElement`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value#collectionelement)
  trait.  These types include [`Bool`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/bool.html#bool),
  [`StringLiteral`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string_literal.html#stringliteral),
  [`DynamicVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list#list),
  [`Tensor`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor.html#tensor),
  [`TensorShape`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor_shape.html#tensor_shape),
  and [`TensorSpec`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor_spec.html#tensor_spec).

### ü¶ã Changed

- `utils.vector` has been moved to a new `collections` package to make
  space for new collections. This means that if you had previous code
  that did `from utils.vector import DynamicVector`, it now needs to
  be `from collections.vector import DynamicVector` due to the move.

- The special destructor method `__del__()` has been changed to enforce
  that it cannot raise an error. Raising destructors are not supported properly
  at the moment.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [#1421](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1421) - Fixed a crash when
  using Tuples in the REPL.

- [#222](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/222) - Generate an error
  for obviously self recursive functions.

- [#1408](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1408) - Fix overload
  resolution when candidates can return generic types.

- [#1413](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1413) and
  [#1395](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1395) - Do not crash when
  re-declaring a builtin declaration.

- [#1307](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1307) - Fix compatibility of
  function signatures that only differ in default argument values.

- [#1380](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1380) - Fix printing
  of empty `String`.

## v0.6.0 (2023-12-04)

### üî• Legendary

- Traits have arrived!

  You can now define a _trait_, which consists of a required set of method
  prototypes. A struct can _conform to_ the trait by implementing these methods.
  This lets you write generic functions that work on any structs that conform to
  a given trait.

  The following section gives a brief overview of traits‚Äîsee the
  [Mojo Manual](/mojo/manual/traits.html) and this
  [traits blog post](https://modul.ar/traits-blog) for more details!

  Traits are declared with the `trait` keyword. The bodies of traits should
  contain method signatures declared with `...` as their bodies. Default
  method implementations are not supported yet.

  ```mojo
  trait SomeTrait:
      fn required_method(self, x: Int): ...
  ```

  The trait can be implemented on a struct by inheriting from it.

  ```mojo
  struct SomeStruct(SomeTrait):
      fn required_method(self, x: Int):
          print("hello traits", x)
  ```

  You can then write a generic functions that accepts any type that conforms to
  the trait. You do this by creating a parameterized function with a
  trait-typed parameter:

  ```mojo
  fn fun_with_traits[T: SomeTrait](x: T):
      x.required_method(42)
  ```

  Which can be invoked with instances of types that conform to the trait:

  ```mojo
  var thing = SomeStruct()
  # Infer the parameter `T`!
  fun_with_traits(thing)
  ```

  Traits can also inherit from other traits, which simply requires that
  implementors of the child trait also conform to all parent traits.

  ```mojo
  trait Parent:
      fn parent_func(self): ...

  trait Child(Parent):
      fn child_func(self): ...
  ```

  Then, both child and parent trait methods can be invoked on instances of
  the trait `Child`. As well, an instance of the child trait can be converted to
  an instance of the parent trait.

  ```mojo
  fn the_parents[T: Parent](x: T):
      x.parent_func()

  fn the_children[T: Child](x: T):
      x.child_func()
      x.parent_func()
      # Upcast `x` from instance of `Child` to `Parent`.
      the_parents(x)
  ```

  For more information, see the [Traits page](/mojo/manual/traits.html)
  in the Mojo Manual.

- A fundamental `Destructable` trait has been added to the language. This is a
  core trait that every trait automatically conforms to. This enables
  destruction of generic types and generic collections.

  **Note:** We're aware that this trait might be better spelled `Destructible`.
  We're planning on removing it in the future and moving its functionality to
  `AnyType` so that any type that doesn't provide its own destructor will have
  a default, no-op destructor.

- We've added some traits to the standard library, you can implement these on
  your own types:

  - [`Destructable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/anytype.html#anytype)
  - [`Copyable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value.html#copyable)
  - [`Movable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value.html#movable)
  - [`Stringable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str.html#stringable)
  - [`Intable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int.html#intable)
  - [`Sized`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/len.html#sized)
  - [`CollectionElement`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value#collectionelement)

- We added built-in [`len()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/len.html#len),
  [`str()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str.html#str), and
  [`int()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int.html#int-1) functions, which work with
  types that implement the `Sized`, `Stringable`, and `Intable` traits,
  respectively.

- [`DynamicVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list#list) is now a
  proper generic collection that can use any type that implements the `Movable`
  and `Copyable` traits. This means you can now write, for example,
  `DynamicVector[String]`. Also, `DynamicVector` now invokes its element
  destructors upon destruction, so `_del_old` has been deleted.

- `print` now works on any types that implement `Stringable` by invoking their
  `__str__` method:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct BoxedInt(Stringable):
      var value: Int

      fn __str__(self) -> String:
          return self.value

  print(BoxedInt(11), "hello traits!", BoxedInt(42))
  ```

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- The [Mojo Manual](/mojo/manual/) is an all-new, complete Mojo user guide.
  It doesn't include _everything_ about Mojo yet, but it includes a lot,
  and more than the original [programming
  manual](/mojo/programming-manual.html) (now deprecated).

  Plus, the entire Mojo Manual and other Mojo docs are now [open-sourced on
  GitHub](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/tree/main/docs), and we'd love
  to accept contributions to help us improve them!

- Mojo now supports partial automatic parameterization: when a function is
  declared with an argument of a partially bound type, the unbound parameters
  of that type are implicitly added to the function's input parameters. For
  example:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct Fudge[a: Int, b: Int, c: Int = 7]: ...

  # These function declarations are roughly equivalent:
  fn eat(f: Fudge[5]): ...               # implicitly parameterized
  fn eat[_b: Int](f: Fudge[5, _b]): ...  # explicitly parameterized
  ```

  In the first signature for `eat()`, the `b` parameter isn't bound, so it's
  _implicitly_ added as an input parameter on the function.

  In the second signature for `eat()`, the author has explicitly defined an
  input parameter (`_b`), which is bound to the second parameter on the argument
  type (which happens to be `b`).

  Both functions can be called like this:

  ```mojo
  eat(Fudge[5, 8]())
  ```

  Mojo infers the value of the `b` parameter from the argument (in this case,
  8).

  With the second signature, you can also pass the `_b` parameter value
  explicitly:

  ```mojo
  eat[3](Fudge[5, 3]())
  ```

  Moreover, Mojo now allows you to explicitly mark parameters as unbound using
  the `_` as syntax meaning "placeholder for an unbound parameter." For example:

  ```mojo
  # These function declarations are roughly equivalent:
  fn eat(f: Fudge[5, _, c=_]): ...                    # implicitly parameterized
  fn eat(f: Fudge[c=_, a=5, b=_]): ...                # implicitly parameterized
  fn eat[_b: Int, _c: Int](f: Fudge[5, _b, _c]): ...  # explicitly parameterized
  ```

  The first two signatures explicitly unbind the `b` and `c` parameters.

  In the last signature, the `_b` and `_c` parameters are explicitly declared by
  the author, and bound to the `b` and `c` parameters in the argument type.

  Any of these signatures can be called like this:

  ```mojo
  eat(Fudge[5, 8]())
  eat(Fudge[5, 8, 9]())
  ```

  Note that the default parameter values of struct parameters are bound, unless
  explicitly unbound by the user.

  For more information, see the
  [Mojo Manual](/mojo/manual/parameters/#partial-automatic-parameterization).

- Parametric types can now be partially bound in certain contexts. For example,
  a new `Scalar` type alias has been added defined as:

  ```mojo
  alias Scalar = SIMD[size=1]
  ```

  Which creates a parametric type alias `Scalar` with a single parameter of type
  `DType`. Types can also be partially or fully bound in other contexts. For
  instance, `alias` declarations of type values inside functions now work
  properly:

  ```mojo
  fn type_aliases():
      alias T = SIMD
      print(T[DType.float32, 1]())
      alias Partial = T[type=DType.int32]
      print(Partial[2]())
  ```

- The `__mlir_op` feature now supports operations that return multiple results.
  To use them, you write the `_type` field as a `Tuple` of types.  For example:

  ```mojo
  # The `ret` variable has type `Tuple[Int, Int]`.
  let ret = __mlir_op.`multi_result_op`[_type=(Int, Int)]()
  ```

- Mojo now has the ability to read raw bytes from a file using the
  [`read_bytes()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file.html#read_bytes) method.
  For example:

  ```mojo
  with open("file.binary", "r") as f:
      data = f.read_bytes()
  ```

- A size argument was added to the
  [`read()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file.html#read) and
  [`read_bytes()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file.html#read_bytes) methods on the
  builtin `file.FileHandle`. The size argument defaults to -1 and maintains the
  previous "read to EOF" behavior when size is negative.

  ```mojo
  with open("file.binary", "r") as f:
      data1 = f.read_bytes(1024)
      data2 = f.read_bytes(256)
  ```

- [`Path`](/mojo/stdlib/pathlib/path.html#path) now has `read_bytes()` and
  `read_text()` methods to read file contents from a path:

  ```mojo
  let text_path = Path("file.txt")
  let text = text_path.read_text()

  let binary_path = Path("file.binary")
  let data = binary_path.read_bytes()
  ```

- [`Tensor`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor.html) has new `save()` and `load()`
  methods to save and load to file. These
  methods preserve shape and datatype information. For example:

  ```mojo
  let tensor = Tensor[DType.float32]()
  tensor.save(path)

  let tensor_from_file = Tensor[DType.float32].load(path)
  ```

- Subscripting added to
  [`DTypePointer`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe.html#dtypepointer) and
  [`Pointer`](/mojo/stdlib/memory/unsafe.html#pointer):

  ```mojo
  let p = DTypePointer[DType.float16].alloc(4)
  for i in range(4):
      p[i] = i
      print(p[i])
  ```

- `file.FileHandle` now has a `seek()` method.

- [`String`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#string) now has an
  [`rfind()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#rfind) method analogous to
  Python's `str.rfind()`.

- `String` now has an [`split()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#split) method
  analogous to Python's `str.split()`.

- [`Path`](/mojo/stdlib/pathlib/path.html#path) now has a
  [`suffix()`](/mojo/stdlib/pathlib/path.html#suffix) method analogous to
  Python's `pathlib.Path.suffix`.

- The Mojo REPL now supports indented expressions, making it a bit easier to
  execute expressions copied from an indented block (such as a doc string).

- The Mojo Language Server now implements the Document Symbols request. IDEs use
  this to provide support for **Outline View** and **Go to Symbol**. This
  addresses [Issue #960](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/960).

- The Mojo Language Server now shows documentation when code completing modules
  or packages in `import` statements.

- The Mojo Language Server now supports processing code examples, defined as
  markdown Mojo code blocks, inside of doc strings. This enables IDE features
  while writing examples in API documentation.

- The Mojo Language Server now provides semantic token information, providing
  better highlighting for symbols whose semantics are not statically analyzable.

- The Mojo Language Server now classifies doc strings as folding ranges,
  making them easier to collapse, reducing vertical space while editing.

- Command line options for the `mojo` driver that take arguments can now be
  written in either of two ways: both `--foo FOO` and `--foo=FOO`. Previously,
  only the former was valid.

### ü¶ã Changed

- Variadic list types
  [`VariadicList`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list.html#variadiclist) and
  [`VariadicListMem`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list.html#variadiclistmem)
  are now iterable. Variadic arguments are automatically projected into one of
  these types inside the function body, so var args can be iterated:

  ```mojo
  fn print_ints(*nums: Int):
      for num in nums:
          print(num)
      print(len(nums))
  ```

- The assert functions in the [`testing`](/mojo/stdlib/testing/testing.html)
  package now raise an `Error` when the assertion fails instead of returning a
  `Bool` for whether the assertion succeeded or not.

- Parameters of [`AnyType`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/type_aliases.html) type are no
  longer (implicitly) assumed to be register-passable. A new `AnyRegType` type
  is used to represent generic types that are register passable.

- Changing the units in a [`benchmark`](/mojo/stdlib/benchmark/benchmark.html)
  report is now an argument instead of a parameter:

  ```mojo
  let report = benchmark.run[timer]()
  report.print(Unit.ms)
  ```

- Default values on `inout` arguments are no longer permitted, i.e. the
  following will now raise an error:

  ```mojo
  fn inout_default(inout x: Int = 2): ...
  ```

- The `to_string()` function has been removed from
  [`PythonObject`](/mojo/stdlib/python/object.html#pythonobject) in favor of
  the new `__str__()` function.  This composes better with traits so it can be
  used with the generic `str()` function.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

  doesn't show autocomplete in if statements.

- [#1246](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/1246) - Warning diagnostics
  are transient in the presence of caching.

### Known Issue

- There is an issue affecting Jupyter notebooks that use autotuning and traits.
  This issue only manifests on macOS, and the same code runs without issue
  outside of the notebooks. This issue affects the _Matrix multiplication in
  Mojo_ notebook.

## v0.5.0 (2023-11-2)

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- The [`SIMD`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd.html#simd) type now defaults to the
  architectural SIMD width of the type. This means you can write
  `SIMD[DType.float32]` which is equivalent to
  `SIMD[DType.float32, simdwidthof[DType.float32]()]`.

- The [`SIMD`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd.html#simd) type now contains a `join()`
  function that allows you to concatenate two `SIMD` values together and produce
  a new `SIMD` value.

- Mojo now supports compile-time _keyword parameters_, in addition to existing
  support for [keyword
  arguments](/mojo/manual/basics/#optional-arguments-and-keyword-arguments). For
  example:

  ```mojo
  fn foo[a: Int, b: Int = 42]():
      print(a, "+", b)

  foo[a=5]()        # prints '5 + 42'
  foo[a=7, b=13]()  # prints '7 + 13'
  foo[b=20, a=6]()  # prints '6 + 20'
  ```

  Keyword parameters are also supported in structs:

  ```mojo
  struct KwParamStruct[a: Int, msg: String = "üî•mojoüî•"]:
      fn __init__(inout self):
          print(msg, a)

  fn use_kw_params():
      KwParamStruct[a=42]()               # prints 'üî•mojoüî• 42'
      KwParamStruct[5, msg="hello"]()     # prints 'hello 5'
      KwParamStruct[msg="hello", a=42]()  # prints 'hello 42'
  ```

  For more detail, see the [programming
  manual](/mojo/manual/parameters/index.html#optional-parameters-and-keyword-parameters).

  For the time being, the following notable limitations apply:

  - Keyword-only parameters are **not supported** yet:

    ```mojo
    fn baz[*args: Int, b: Int](): pass  # fails
    fn baz[a: Int, *, b: Int](): pass  # fails
    ```

    (The analogous keyword-only arguments in Python are described in
    [PEP 3102](https://peps.python.org/pep-3102/).)

  - Variadic keyword parameters are **not supported** yet:

    ```mojo
    fn baz[a: Int, **kwargs: Int](): pass  # fails
    ```

- Mojo now supports "automatic" parameterization of functions. What this means
  is that if a function argument type is parametric but has no bound parameters,
  they are automatically added as input parameters on the function. This works
  with existing features to allow you to write parametric functions with less
  boilerplate.

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct Thing[x: Int, y: Int]:
      pass

  fn foo(v: Thing):
      print(v.x)
      print(v.y)

  fn main():
      let v = Thing[2, 3]()
      foo(v)
  ```

  However, partial autoparameterization is **not supported** yet:

  ```mojo
  fn foo(v: Thing[y=7]):  # Partially bound type not allowed yet.
      ...
  ```

- Keyword argument passing is supported when invoking `__getitem__` using
  the bracket syntax:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct MyStruct:
      fn __getitem__(self, x: Int, y: Int, z: Int) -> Int:
          return x * y + z

  MyStruct()[z=7, x=3, y=5]  # returns 22
  ```

  However, keyword argument passing to `__setitem__` using the bracket syntax is
  **not supported** yet:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct OtherStruct:
      fn __setitem__(self, x: Int, y: Int): pass

  OtherStruct()[x=1] = 4  # fails
  ```

- Function argument input parameters can now be referenced within the signature
  of the function:

  ```mojo
  fn foo(x: SIMD, y: SIMD[x.type, x.size]):
      pass
  ```

- The [`benchmark`](/mojo/stdlib/benchmark/benchmark.html) module has been
  simplified and improved so you can now run:

  ```mojo
  import benchmark
  from time import sleep

  fn sleeper():
      sleep(.01)

  fn main():
      let report = benchmark.run[sleeper]()
      print(report.mean())
  ```

  It no longer requires a capturing `fn` so can benchmark functions outside the
  same scope.

  You can print a report with:

  ```mojo
  report.print()
  ```

  ```plaintext
  ---------------------
  Benchmark Report (s)
  ---------------------
  Mean: 0.012314264957264957
  Total: 1.440769
  Iters: 117
  Warmup Mean: 0.0119335
  Warmup Total: 0.023866999999999999
  Warmup Iters: 2
  Fastest Mean: 0.012227958333333334
  Slowest Mean: 0.012442699999999999
  ```

  Units for all functions default to seconds, but can be changed with:

  ```mojo
  from benchmark import Unit

  report.print[Unit.ms]()
  ```

- Mojo now supports struct parameter deduction (a.k.a. class template argument
  deduction, or CTAD) for partially bound types. Struct parameter deduction is
  also possible from static methods. For example:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct Thing[v: Int]: pass

  struct CtadStructWithDefault[a: Int, b: Int, c: Int = 8]:
      fn __init__(inout self, x: Thing[a]):
          print("hello", a, b, c)

      @staticmethod
      fn foo(x: Thing[a]):
          print("üî•", a, b, c)

  fn main():
      _ = CtadStructWithDefault[b=7](Thing[6]())  # prints 'hello 6 7 8'
      CtadStructWithDefault[b=7].foo(Thing[6]())  # prints 'üî• 6 7 8'
  ```

- [`Tensor`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor.html) has new `fromfile()` and
  `tofile()` methods to save and load as bytes from a file.

- The built-in `print()` function now works on the
  [`Tensor`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor.html) type.

- [`TensorShape`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor_shape.html) and
  [`TensorSpec`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor_shape.html) now have constructors
  that take [`DynamicVector[Int]`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list#list)
  and [`StaticIntTuple`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/index_.html#staticinttuple) to
  initialize shapes.

- The [`String`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string.html#string) type now has the
 `count()` and `find()` methods to enable counting the number of occurrences or
  finding the offset index of a substring in a string.

- The `String` type now has a `replace()` method which allows you to replace a
  substring with another string.

### ü¶ã Changed

- [`VariadicList`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list.html#variadiclist) and
  [`VariadicListMem`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/builtin_list.html#variadiclistmem)
  moved under builtins, and no longer need to be imported.

- Variadic arguments are now automatically projected into a `VariadicList` or
  `VariadicListMem` inside the function body. This allows for more flexibility
  in using var args. For example:

  ```mojo
    fn print_ints(*nums: Int):
        let len = len(nums)
        for i in range(len):
            print(nums[i])
        print(len)
  ```

- The parameters for
  [`InlinedFixedVector`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/vector.html#inlinedfixedvector)
  have been switched. The parameters are now `[type, size]` instead of
  `[size, type]`. The `InlinedFixedVector` now has a default size which means
  that one can just use `InlinedFixedVector` as `InlinedFixedVector[Float32]`
  and the default size is used.

- `write_file()` method in [`Buffer`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/buffer.html#buffer)
  and [`NDBuffer`](/mojo/stdlib/buffer/buffer.html#ndbuffer) is renamed to
  `tofile()` to match the Python naming.

- Mojo will now utilize all available cores across all NUMA sockets on the host
  machine by default. The prior default behavior was to use all the cores on
  the first socket.

### ‚ùå Removed

- The `math.numerics` module is now private, because its types (`FPUtils` and
  `FlushDenormals`) should not be used externally.

## v0.4.0 for Mac (2023-10-19)

### üî• Legendary

- Mojo for Mac!

  The Mojo SDK now works on macOS (Apple silicon). This is the same version
  previously released for Linux. Get the latest version of the SDK for your Mac
  system:

  [Download Now!](https://developer.modular.com/download)

## v0.4.0 (2023-10-05)

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Mojo now supports default parameter values. For example:

  ```mojo
  fn foo[a: Int = 3, msg: StringLiteral = "woof"]():
      print(msg, a)

  fn main():
      foo()  # prints 'woof 3'
      foo[5]()  # prints 'woof 5'
      foo[7, "meow"]()  # prints 'meow 7'
  ```

  Inferred parameter values take precedence over defaults:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct Bar[v: Int]:
      pass

  fn foo[a: Int = 42, msg: StringLiteral = "quack"](bar: Bar[a]):
      print(msg, a)

  fn main():
      foo(Bar[9]())  # prints 'quack 9'
  ```

  Structs also support default parameters:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct DefaultParams[msg: StringLiteral = "woof"]:
      alias message = msg

  fn main():
      print(DefaultParams[]().message)  # prints 'woof'
      print(DefaultParams["meow"]().message)  # prints 'meow'
  ```

- The new [`file`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file.html) module adds basic file I/O
  support. You can now write:

  ```mojo
  var f = open("my_file.txt", "r")
  print(f.read())
  f.close()
  ```

  or

  ```mojo
  with open("my_file.txt", "r") as f:
      print(f.read())
  ```

- Mojo now allows context managers to support an `__enter__` method without
  implementing support for an `__exit__` method, enabling idioms like this:

  ```mojo
  # This context manager consumes itself and returns it as the value.
  fn __enter__(owned self) -> Self:
      return self^
  ```

  Here Mojo _cannot_ invoke a noop `__exit__` method because the context
  manager is consumed by the `__enter__` method.  This can be used for types
  (like file descriptors) that are traditionally used with `with` statements,
  even though Mojo's guaranteed early destruction doesn't require that.

- A very basic version of `pathlib` has been implemented in Mojo. The
  module will be improved to achieve functional parity with Python in
  the next few releases.

- The `memory.unsafe` module now contains a `bitcast` function. This is a
  low-level operation that enables bitcasting between pointers and scalars.

- The input parameters of a parametric type can now be directly accessed as
  attribute references on the type or variables of the type. For example:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct Thing[param: Int]:
      pass

  fn main():
      print(Thing[2].param) # prints '2'
      let x = Thing[9]()
      print(x.param) # prints '9'
  ```

  Input parameters on values can even be accessed in parameter contexts. For
  example:

  ```mojo
  fn foo[value: Int]():
      print(value)

  let y = Thing[12]()
  alias constant = y.param + 4
  foo[constant]() # prints '16'
  ```

- The Mojo REPL now supports code completion. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> while typing
  to query potential completion results.

- Error messages from Python are now exposed in Mojo. For example the following
  should print `No module named 'my_uninstalled_module'`:

  ```mojo
  fn main():
      try:
          let my_module = Python.import_module("my_uninstalled_module")
      except e:
          print(e)
  ```

- Error messages can now store dynamic messages. For example, the following
  should print "Failed on: Hello"

  ```mojo
  fn foo(x: String) raises:
      raise Error("Failed on: " + x)

  fn main():
      try:
          foo("Hello")
      except e:
          print(e)
  ```

### ü¶ã Changed

- We have improved and simplified the `parallelize` function. The function
  now elides some overhead by caching the Mojo parallel runtime.

- The Mojo REPL and Jupyter environments no longer implicitly expose `Python`,
  `PythonObject`, or `Pointer`. These symbols must now be imported explicitly,
  for example:

  ```mojo
  from python import Python
  from python.object import PythonObject
  from memory.unsafe import Pointer
  ```

- The syntax for specifying attributes with the `__mlir_op` prefix have changed
  to mimic Python's keyword argument passing syntax. That is, `=` should be used
  instead of `:`, e.g.:

  ```mojo
  # Old syntax, now fails.
  __mlir_op.`index.bool.constant`[value : __mlir_attr.`false`]()
  # New syntax.
  __mlir_op.`index.bool.constant`[value=__mlir_attr.`false`]()
  ```

- You can now print the `Error` object directly. The `message()` method
  has been removed.

  on python exception.

## v0.3.1 (2023-09-28)

Our first-ever patch release of the Mojo SDK is here! Release v0.3.1
includes primarily installation-related fixes. If you‚Äôve had trouble
installing the previous versions of the SDK, this release may be for you.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [#538](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/538) - Installation hangs
  during the testing phase. This issue occurs on machines with a low number
  of CPU cores, such as free AWS EC2 instances and GitHub Codespaces.
- [#590](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/590) - Installation fails
  with a ‚Äúfailed to run python‚Äù message.
- [#672](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/672) - Language server hangs
  on code completion. Related to #538, this occurs on machines with a low
  number of CPU cores.
- [#913](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/913) - In the REPL and Jupyter
  notebooks, inline comments were being parsed incorrectly.

## v0.3.0 (2023-09-21)

There's more Mojo to love in this, the second release of the Mojo SDK! This
release includes new features, an API change, and bug fixes.

There's also an updated version of the [Mojo extension for VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo).

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Mojo now has partial support for passing keyword arguments to functions and
  methods. For example the following should work:

  ```mojo
  fn foo(a: Int, b: Int = 3) -> Int:
      return a * b

  fn main():
      print(foo(6, b=7))  # prints '42'
      print(foo(a=6, b=7))  # prints '42'
      print(foo(b=7, a=6))  # prints '42'
  ```

  Parameters can also be inferred from keyword arguments, for example:

  ```mojo
  fn bar[A: AnyType, B: AnyType](a: A, b: B):
      print("Hello üî•")

  fn bar[B: AnyType](a: StringLiteral, b: B):
      print(a)

  fn main():
      bar(1, 2)  # prints `Hello üî•`
      bar(b=2, a="Yay!")  # prints `Yay!`
  ```

  For the time being, the following notable limitations apply:

  - Keyword-only arguments are not supported:

    ```mojo
    fn baz(*args: Int, b: Int): pass  # fails
    fn baz(a: Int, *, b: Int): pass  # fails
    ```

    (Keyword-only arguments are described in
    [PEP 3102](https://peps.python.org/pep-3102/).)

  - Variadic keyword arguments are not supported:

    ```mojo
    fn baz(a: Int, **kwargs: Int): pass  # fails
    ```

- Mojo now supports the `@nonmaterializable` decorator.  The purpose is to mark
  data types that should only exist in the parameter domain.  To use it, a
  struct is decorated with `@nonmaterializable(TargetType)`.  Any time the
  nonmaterializable type is converted from the parameter domain, it is
  automatically converted to `TargetType`.  A nonmaterializable struct should
  have all of its methods annotated as `@always_inline`, and must be computable
  in the parameter domain.  In the following example, the `NmStruct` type can
  be added in the parameter domain, but are converted to `HasBool` when
  materialized.

  ```mojo
  @value
  @register_passable("trivial")
  struct HasBool:
      var x: Bool
      fn __init__(x: Bool) -> Self:
          return Self {x: x}
      @always_inline("nodebug")
      fn __init__(nms: NmStruct) -> Self:
          return Self {x: True if (nms.x == 77) else False}

  @value
  @nonmaterializable(HasBool)
  @register_passable("trivial")
  struct NmStruct:
      var x: Int
      @always_inline("nodebug")
      fn __add__(self: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self:
          return NmStruct(self.x + rhs.x)

  alias stillNmStruct = NmStruct(1) + NmStruct(2)
  # When materializing to a run-time variable, it is automatically converted,
  # even without a type annotation.
  let convertedToHasBool = stillNmStruct
  ```

- Mojo integer literals now produce the `IntLiteral` infinite precision integer
  type when used in the parameter domain.  `IntLiteral` is materialized to the
  `Int` type for runtime computation, but intermediate computations at compile
  time, using supported operators, can now exceed the bit width of the `Int`
  type.

- The Mojo Language Server now supports top-level code completions, enabling
  completion when typing a reference to a variable, type, etc. This resolves
  [#679](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/679).

- The Mojo REPL now colorizes the resultant variables to help distinguish input
  expressions from the output variables.

### ü¶ã Changed

- Mojo allows types to implement two forms of move constructors, one that is
  invoked when the lifetime of one value ends, and one that is invoked if the
  compiler cannot prove that.  These were previously both named `__moveinit__`,
  with the following two signatures:

  ```mojo
  fn __moveinit__(inout self, owned existing: Self): ...
  fn __moveinit__(inout self, inout existing: Self): ...
  ```

  We've changed the second form to get its own name to make it more clear that
  these are two separate operations: the second has been renamed to
  `__takeinit__`:

  ```mojo
  fn __moveinit__(inout self, owned existing: Self): ...
  fn __takeinit__(inout self, inout existing: Self): ...
  ```

  The name is intended to connote that the operation takes the conceptual value
  from the source (without destroying it) unlike the first one which "moves" a
  value from one location to another.

  For more information, see the Mojo Manual section on
  [move constructors](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life.html#move-constructors).

- The Error type in Mojo has changed. Instead of extracting the error message
  using `error.value` you will now extract the error message using
  `error.message()`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [#503](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/503) - Improve error message
  for failure lowering `kgen.param.constant`.
- [#554](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/554) - Alias of static tuple
  fails to expand.
- [#500](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/500) - Call expansion failed
  due to verifier error.
- [#422](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/422) - Incorrect comment
  detection in multiline strings.
- [#729](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/740) - Improve messaging on
  how to exit the REPL.
- [#756](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/756) - Fix initialization
  errors of the VS Code extension.
- [#575](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/575) - Build LLDB/REPL with
  libedit for a nicer editing experience in the terminal.

## v0.2.1 (2023-09-07)

The first versioned release of Mojo! üî•

All earlier releases were considered version 0.1.

### üî• Legendary

- First release of the Mojo SDK!

  You can now develop with Mojo locally. The Mojo SDK is currently available
  for Ubuntu Linux systems, and support for Windows and macOS is coming soon.
  You can still develop from a Windows or Mac computer using a container or
  remote Linux system.

  The Mojo SDK includes the Mojo standard library and the [Mojo command-line
  interface](/mojo/cli/) (CLI), which allows you to run, compile, and package
  Mojo code. It also provides a REPL programming environment.

  [Get the Mojo SDK!](https://developer.modular.com/download)

- First release of the [Mojo extension for VS
  Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo).

  This provides essential Mojo language features in Visual Studio Code, such as
  code completion, code quick fixes, docs tooltips, and more. Even when
  developing on a remote system, using VS Code with this extension provides
  a native-like IDE experience.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- A new `clobber_memory` function has been added to the
  [`benchmark`](/mojo/stdlib/benchmark/benchmark.html) module.
  The clobber memory function tells the system to flush all memory operations
  at the specified program point. This allows you to benchmark operations
  without the compiler reordering memory operations.

- A new `keep` function has been added to the
  [`benchmark`](/mojo/stdlib/benchmark/benchmark.html) module. The `keep`
  function tries to tell the compiler not to optimize the variable away
  if not used. This allows you to avoid compiler's dead code elimination
  mechanism, with a low footprint side effect.

- New `shift_right` and `shift_left` functions have been added to the
  [`simd`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/simd.html) module. They shift the elements in
  a SIMD vector right/left, filling elements with zeros as needed.

- A new `cumsum` function has been added to the
  [`reduction`](/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/reduction.html) module that computes
  the cumulative sum (also known as scan) of input elements.

- Mojo Jupyter kernel now supports code completion.

### ü¶ã Changed

- Extends `rotate_bits_left`, `rotate_left`, `rotate_bits_right`, and
  `rotate_right` to operate on Int values. The ordering of parameters has also
  been changed to enable type inference. Now it's possible to write
  `rotate_right[shift_val](simd_val)` and have the `dtype` and `simd_width`
  inferred from the argument. This addresses
  [Issue #528](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/528).

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- Fixed a bug causing the parser to crash when the `with` statement was written
  without a colon.
  This addresses [Issue #529](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/529).

- Incorrect imports no longer crash when there are other errors at the top
  level of a module. This fixes [Issue
  #531](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/531).

## August 2023

### 2023-08-24

- Fixed issue where the `with expr as x` statement within `fn` behaved
  as if it were in a `def`, binding `x` with function scope instead of using
  lexical scope.

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Major refactoring of the standard library to enable packaging and better
  import ergonomics:
  - The packages are built as binaries to improve startup speed.
  - Package and module names are now lowercase to align with the Python style.
  - Modules have been moved to better reflect the purpose of the underlying
    functions (e.g. `Pointer` is now within the `unsafe` module in the `memory`
    package).
  - The following modules are now included as built-ins:
    `SIMD`, `DType`, `IO`, `Object`, and `String`.
    This means it's no longer necessary to explicitly import these modules.
    Instead, these modules will be implicitly imported for the user. Private
    methods within the module are still accessible using the
    `builtin.module_name._private_method` import syntax.
  - New `math` package has been added to contain the `bit`, `math`, `numerics`,
    and `polynomial` modules. The contents of the `math.math` module are
    re-exported into the `math` package.

- Mojo now supports using memory-only types in parameter expressions and as
  function or type parameters:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct IntPair:
      var first: Int
      var second: Int

  fn add_them[value: IntPair]() -> Int:
      return value.first + value.second

  fn main():
      print(add_them[IntPair(1, 2)]()) # prints '3'
  ```

- In addition, Mojo supports evaluating code that uses heap-allocated memory
  at compile-time and materializing compile-time values with heap-allocated
  memory into dynamic values:

  ```mojo
  fn fillVector(lowerBound: Int, upperBound: Int, step: Int) -> DynamicVector[Int]:
      var result = DynamicVector[Int]()
      for i in range(lowerBound, upperBound, step):
          result.push_back(i)
      return result

  fn main():
      alias values = fillVector(5, 23, 7)
      for i in range(0, values.__len__()):
          print(values[i]) # prints '5', '12', and then '19'
  ```

#### ü¶ã Changed

- `def main():`, without the explicit `None` type, can now be used to define
  the entry point to a Mojo program.

- The `assert_param` function has been renamed to `constrained` and is now
  a built-in function.

- The `print` function now works on `Complex` values.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- Fixed issues with print formatting for `DType.uint16` and `DType.int16`.
- [Issue #499](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/499) - Two new
  `rotate_right` and `rotate_left` functions have been added to the SIMD module.
- [Issue #429](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/429) - You can now
  construct a `Bool` from a `SIMD` type whose element-type is `DType.bool`.
- [Issue #350](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/350) - Confusing Matrix
  implementation
- [Issue #349](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/349) - Missing load_tr
  in struct Matrix
- [Issue #501](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/501) - Missing syntax
  error messages in Python expressions.

### 2023-08-09

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The `ref` and `mutref` identifiers are now treated as keywords, which means
  they cannot be used as variable, attribute, or function names.  These keywords
  are used by the "lifetimes" features, which is still in development.  We can
  consider renaming these (as well as other related keywords) when the
  development work gels, support is enabled in public Mojo builds, and when we
  have experience using them.

- The argument handling in `def` functions has changed: previously, they had
  special behavior that involved mutable copies in the callee. Now, we have a
  simple rule, which is that `def` argument default to the `owned` convention
  (`fn` arguments still default to the `borrowed` convention).

  This change is mostly an internal cleanup and simplification of the compiler
  and argument model, but does enable one niche use-case: you can now pass
  non-copyable types to `def` arguments by transferring ownership of a value
  into the `def` call. Before, that would not be possible because the copy was
  made on the callee side, not the caller's side. This also allows the explicit
  use of the `borrowed` keyword with a `def` that wants to opt-in to that
  behavior.

### 2023-08-03

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- A new [`Tensor`](/mojo/stdlib/tensor/tensor#tensor) type has been introduced.
  This tensor type manages its own data (unlike `NDBuffer` and `Buffer` which
  are just views). Therefore, the tensor type performs its own allocation and
  free. Here is a simple example of using the tensor type to represent an RGB
  image and convert it to grayscale:

  ```mojo
  from tensor import Tensor, TensorShape
  from utils.index import Index
  from random import rand

  let height = 256
  let width = 256
  let channels = 3

  # Create the tensor of dimensions height, width, channels and fill with
  # random value.
  let image = rand[DType.float32](height, width, channels)

  # Declare the grayscale image.
  var gray_scale_image = Tensor[DType.float32](height, width)

  # Perform the RGB to grayscale transform.
  for y in range(height):
      for x in range(width):
          let r = image[y, x, 0]
          let g = image[y, x, 1]
          let b = image[y, x, 2]
          gray_scale_image[Index(y, x)] = 0.299 * r + 0.587 * g + 0.114 * b
  ```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #53](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/53) - `Int` now
  implements true division with the `/` operator. Similar to Python, this
  returns a 64-bit floating point number. The corresponding in-place operator,
  `/=`, has the same semantics as `//=`.

## July 2023

### 2023-07-26

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Types that define both `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` (i.e. where
  sub-scripting instances creates computed LValues) can now be indexed
  in parameter expressions.

- Unroll decorator for loops with constant bounds and steps:
  - `@unroll`: Fully unroll a loop.
  - `@unroll(n)`: Unroll a loop by factor of n, where `n` is a positive integer.
  - Unroll decorator requires loop bounds and iteration step to be
  compiler time constant value, otherwise unrolling will fail with
  compilation error. This also doesn't make loop induction variable a parameter.

  ```mojo
  # Fully unroll the loop.
  @unroll
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)

  # Unroll the loop by a factor of 4 (with remainder iterations of 2).
  @unroll(4)
  for i in range(10):
      print(i)
  ```

- The Mojo REPL now prints the values of variables defined in the REPL. There is
  full support for scalars and structs. Non-scalar SIMD vectors are not
  supported at this time.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #437](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/437) - Range can now
  be instantiated with a PythonObject.

- [Issue #288](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/288) - Python strings
  can now be safely copied.

### 2023-07-20

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Mojo now includes a `Limits` module, which contains functions to get the max
  and min values representable by a type, as requested in [Issue
  #51](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/51). The following functions
  moved from `Math` to `Limits`: `inf()`, `neginf()`, `isinf()`, `isfinite()`.

- Mojo decorators are now distinguished between "signature" and "body"
  decorators and are ordered. Signature decorators, like `@register_passable`
  and `@parameter`, modify the type of declaration before the body is parsed.
  Body decorators, like `@value`, modify the body of declaration after it is
  fully parsed. Due to ordering, a signature decorator cannot be applied after
  a body decorator. That means the following is now invalid:

  ```mojo
  @register_passable # error: cannot apply signature decorator after a body one!
  @value
  struct Foo:
      pass
  ```

- Global variables can now be exported in Mojo compiled archives, using the
  `@export` decorator. Exported global variables are public symbols in compiled
  archives and use the variable name as its linkage name, by default. A custom
  linkage name can be specified with `@export("new_name")`. This does not affect
  variable names in Mojo code.

- Mojo now supports packages! A Mojo package is defined by placing an
  `__init__.mojo` or `__init__.üî•` within a directory. Other files in the same
  directory form modules within the package (this works exactly like it
  does [in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages)).
  Example:

  ```bash
  main.üî•
  my_package/
    __init__.üî•
    module.üî•
    my_other_package/
      __init__.üî•
      stuff.üî•
  ```

  ```mojo
  # main.üî•
  from my_package.module import some_function
  from my_package.my_other_package.stuff import SomeType

  fn main():
      var x: SomeType = some_function()
  ```

- Mojo now supports direct module and package imports! Modules and packages can
  be imported and bound to names. Module and package elements, like functions,
  types, global variables, and other modules, can be accessed using attribute
  references, like `my_module.foo`. Note that modules lack runtime
  representations, meaning module references cannot be instantiated.

  ```mojo
  import builtin.io as io
  import SIMD

  io.print("hello world")
  var x: SIMD.Float32 = 1.2
  ```

#### ü¶ã Changed

- Reverted the feature from 2023-02-13 that allowed unqualified struct members.
  Use the `Self` keyword to conveniently access struct members with bound
  parameters instead.  This was required to fix
  [Issue #260](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/260).

- Updated the RayTracing notebook: added step 5 to create specular lighting for
  more realistic images and step 6 to add a background image.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #260](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/260) - Definitions
  inside structs no longer shadow definitions outside of struct definitions.

### 2023-07-12

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Mojo now has support for global variables! This enables `var` and `let`
  declaration at the top-level scope in Mojo files. Global variable initializers
  are run when code modules are loaded by the platform according to the order of
  dependencies between global variables, and their destructors are called in the
  reverse order.

- The [Mojo programming manual](/mojo/programming-manual.html) is now written
  as a Jupyter notebook, and available in its entirety in the Mojo Playground
  (`programming-manual.ipynb`). (Previously, `HelloMojo.ipynb` included most of
  the same material, but it was not up-to-date.)

- As a result, we've also re-written `HelloMojo.ipynb` to be much shorter and
  provide a more gentle first-user experience.

- [`Coroutine` module documentation](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/coroutine) is now
  available. Coroutines form the basis of Mojo's support for asynchronous
  execution. Calls to `async fn`s can be stored into a `Coroutine`, from which
  they can be resumed, awaited upon, and have their results retrieved upon
  completion.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- `simd_bit_width` in the `TargetInfo` module has been renamed to `simdbitwidth`
  to better align with `simdwidthof`, `bitwidthof`, etc.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- The walrus operator now works in if/while statements without parentheses,
  e.g. `if x := function():`.

- [Issue #428](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/428) - The
  `FloatLiteral` and `SIMD` types now support conversion to `Int` via the
  `to_int` or `__int__` method calls. The behavior matches that of Python, which
  rounds towards zero.

### 2023-07-05

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Tuple expressions now work without parentheses. For example, `a, b = b, a`
  works as you'd expect in Python.
- Chained assignments (e.g. `a = b = 42`) and the walrus operator (e.g.
  `some_function(b := 17)`) are now supported.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The `simd_width` and `dtype_simd_width` functions in the
  [`TargetInfo`](/mojo/stdlib/sys/info) module
  have been renamed to `simdwidthof`.

- The `dtype_` prefix has been dropped from `alignof`, `sizeof`, and
  `bitwidthof`. You can now use these functions (e.g. `alignof`) with any
  argument type, including `DType`.

- The `inf`, `neginf`, `nan`, `isinf`, `isfinite`, and `isnan` functions were
  moved from the `Numerics` module to the [`Math`](/mojo/MojoStdlib/Math.html)
  module, to better align with Python's library structure.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #253](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/253) - Issue
  when accessing a struct member alias without providing parameters.

- [Issue #404](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/404) - The docs now use
  `snake_case` for variable names, which more closely conforms to Python's
  style.

- [Issue #379](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/379) - Tuple
  limitations have been addressed and multiple return values are now supported,
  even without parentheses.

- [Issue #347](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/347) - Tuples no longer
  require parentheses.

- [Issue #320](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/320) - Python objects
  are now traversable via `for` loops.

## June 2023

### 2023-06-29

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- You can now share `.ipynb` notebook files in Mojo Playground. Just save a
  file in the `shared` directory, and then right-click the file and select
  **Copy Sharable link**. To open a shared notebook, you must already have
  [access to Mojo Playground](/mojo/manual/get-started/#develop-in-the-mojo-playground);
  when you open a shared notebook, click **Import** at the top of the notebook
  to save your own copy. For more details about this feature, see the
  instructions inside the `help` directory, in the Mojo Playground file browser.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The `unroll2()` and `unroll3()` functions in the
  [`Functional`](/mojo/stdlib/algorithm/functional) module have been renamed to
  overload the `unroll()` function. These functions unroll 2D and 3D loops and
  `unroll()` can determine the intent based on the number of input parameters.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #229](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/229) - Issue when
  throwing an exception from `__init__` before all fields are initialized.

- [Issue #74](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/74) - Struct
  definition with recursive reference crashes.

- [Issue #285](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/285) - The
  [`TargetInfo`](/mojo/stdlib/sys/info) module now includes
  `is_little_endian()` and `is_big_endian()` to check if the target host uses
  either little or big endian.

- [Issue #254](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/254) - Parameter name
  shadowing in nested scopes is now handled correctly.

### 2023-06-21

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Added support for overloading on parameter signature. For example, it is now
possible to write the following:

  ```mojo
  fn foo[a: Int](x: Int):
      pass

  fn foo[a: Int, b: Int](x: Int):
      pass
  ```

  For details on the overload resolution logic, see the Mojo Manual section on
  [parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters/index.html#overloading-on-parameters).

- A new `cost_of()` function has been added to `Autotune`. This meta-function
  must be invoked at compile time, and it returns the number of MLIR operations
  in a function (at a certain stage in compilation), which can be used to
  build basic heuristics in higher-order generators.

  ```mojo
  from autotune import cost_of

  fn generator[f: fn(Int) -> Int]() -> Int:
      @parameter
      if cost_of[fn(Int) -> Int, f]() < 10:
          return f()
      else:
          # Do something else for slower functions...
  ```

- Added a new example notebook with a basic Ray Tracing algorithm.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The `constrained_msg()` in the `Assert` module has been renamed to
  `constrained()`.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- Overloads marked with `@adaptive` now correctly handle signatures that differ
only in declared parameter names, e.g. the following now works correctly:

  ```mojo
  @adaptive
  fn foobar[w: Int, T: DType]() -> SIMD[T, w]: ...

  @adaptive
  fn foobar[w: Int, S: DType]() -> SIMD[S, w]: ...
  ```

- [Issue #219](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/219) - Issue when
  redefining a function and a struct defined in the same cell.

- [Issue #355](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/355) - The loop order
  in the Matmul notebook for Python and naive mojo have been reordered for
  consistency. The loop order now follows (M, K, N) ordering.

- [Issue #309](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/309) - Use snake case
  naming within the testing package and move the asserts out of the TestSuite
  struct.

### 2023-06-14

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Tuple type syntax is now supported, e.g. the following works:

  ```mojo
  fn return_tuple() -> (Int, Int):
      return (1, 2)
  ```

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The `TupleLiteral` type was renamed to just `Tuple`, e.g.
  `Tuple[Int, Float]`.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #354](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/354) - Returning a tuple
  doesn't work even with parens.
- [Issue #365](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/365) - Copy-paste error
  in `FloatLiteral` docs.
- [Issue #357](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/357) - Crash when
  missing input parameter to variadic parameter struct member function.

### 2023-06-07

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Tuple syntax now works on the left-hand side of assignments (in "lvalue"
  positions), enabling things like `(a, b) = (b, a)`.  There are several
  caveats: the element types must exactly match (no implicit conversions),
  this only works with values of `TupleLiteral` type (notably, it will not work
  with `PythonObject` yet) and parentheses are required for tuple syntax.

#### ‚ùå Removed

- Mojo Playground no longer includes the following Python packages (due to size,
  compute costs, and [environment complications](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/300)):
  `torch`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `transformers`.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The data types and scalar names now conform to the naming convention used
  by numpy. So we use `Int32` instead of `SI32`, similarly using `Float32`
  instead of `F32`. Closes [Issue #152](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/152).

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- [Issue #287](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/287) - computed
  lvalues don't handle raising functions correctly
- [Issue #318](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/318) - Large integers
  are not being printed correctly
- [Issue #326](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/326) - Float modulo
  operator is not working as expected
- [Issue #282](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/282) - Default arguments
  are not working as expected
- [Issue #271](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/271) - Confusing error
  message when converting between function types with different result semantics

## May 2023

### 2023-05-31

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Mojo Playground now includes the following Python packages (in response to
  [popular demand](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/discussions/173)):
  `torch`, `tensorflow`, `polars`, `opencv-python`, `keras`, `Pillow`, `plotly`,
  `seaborn`, `sympy`, `transformers`.

- A new optimization is applied to non-trivial copyable values that are passed
  as an owned value without using the transfer (`^`) operator.  Consider code
  like this:

  ```mojo
  var someValue: T = ...
  ...
  takeValueAsOwned(someValue)
  ...
  ```

  When `takeValueAsOwned()` takes its argument as an
  [`owned`](/mojo/manual/values/ownership.html#transfer-arguments-owned-and)
  value (this is
  common in initializers for example), it is allowed to do whatever it wants
  with the value and destroy it when it is finished. In order to support this,
  the Mojo compiler is forced to make a temporary copy of the `someValue`
  value, and pass that value instead of `someValue`, because there may be other
  uses of `someValue` after the call.

  The Mojo compiler is now smart enough to detect when there are no uses of
  `someValue` later, and it will elide the copy just as if you had manually
  specified the transfer operator like `takeValueAsOwned(someValue^)`.  This
  provides a nice "it just works" behavior for non-trivial types without
  requiring manual management of transfers.

  If you'd like to take full control and expose full ownership for your type,
  just don't make it copyable.  Move-only types require the explicit transfer
  operator so you can see in your code where all ownership transfer happen.

- Similarly, the Mojo compiler now transforms calls to `__copyinit__` methods
  into calls to `__moveinit__` when that is the last use of the source value
  along a control flow path. This allows types which are both copyable and
  movable to get transparent move optimization. For example, the following code
  is compiled into moves instead of copies even without the use of the transfer
  operator:

  ```mojo
    var someValue = somethingCopyableAndMovable()
    use(someValue)
    ...
    let otherValue = someValue      # Last use of someValue
    use(otherValue)
    ...
    var yetAnother = otherValue     # Last use of otherValue
    mutate(yetAnother)
  ```

  This is a significant performance optimization for things like `PythonObject`
  (and more complex value semantic types) that are commonly used in a fluid
  programming style.  These don't want extraneous reference counting operations
  performed by its copy constructor.

  If you want explicit control over copying, it is recommended to use a
  non-dunder `.copy()` method instead of `__copyinit__`, and recall that
  non-copyable types must always use of the transfer operator for those that
  want fully explicit behavior.

   when a Python expression raises an exception
- [Issue #119](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/119) - The REPL fails
   when a python variable is redefined

### 2023-05-24

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- `finally` clauses are now supported on `try` statements. In addition, `try`
  statements no longer require `except` clauses, allowing `try-finally` blocks.
  `finally` clauses contain code that is always executed from control-flow
  leaves any of the other clauses of a `try` statement by any means.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- `with` statement emission changed to use the new `finally` logic so that

  ```mojo
  with ContextMgr():
      return
  ```

  Will correctly execute `ContextMgr.__exit__` before returning.

### 2023-05-16

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- Added missing dunder methods to `PythonObject`, enabling the use of common
  arithmetic and logical operators on imported Python values.

- `PythonObject` is now printable from Mojo, instead of requiring you to import
  Python's print function.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

### 2023-05-11

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

- `NDBuffer` and `Buffer` are now constructable via `Pointer` and
  `DTypePointer`.

- `String` now supports indexing with either integers or slices.

- Added factorial function to the `Math` module.

#### ü¶ã Changed

- The "byref" syntax with the `&` sigil has changed to use an `inout`
  keyword to be more similar to the `borrowed` and `owned` syntax in arguments.
  Please see [Issue #7](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues/7) for more
  information.

- Optimized the Matrix multiplication implementation in the notebook.
  Initially we were optimizing for expandability rather than performance. We
  have found a way to get the best of both worlds and now the performance of the
  optimized Matmul implementation is 3x faster.

- Renamed the [`^` postfix

including a [wonderful post by Jeremy
Howard](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-05-03-mojo-launch.html). The team is
busy this week.

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è New

#### ü¶ã Changed

- Decreased memory usage of serialization of integers to strings.

- Speedup the sort function.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- Fixed time unit in the `sleep` function.

## April 2023

### Week of 2023-04-24

- üì¢ The default behavior of nested functions has been changed. Mojo nested
  functions that capture are by default are non-parametric, runtime closures,
  meaning that:

  ```mojo
  def foo(x):
      # This:
      def bar(y): return x * y
      # Is the same as:
      let bar = lambda y: x * y
  ```

  These closures cannot have input or result parameters, because they are always
  materialized as runtime values. Values captured in the closure (`x` in the
  above example), are captured by copy: values with copy constructors cannot be
  copied and captures are immutable in the closure.

  Nested functions that don't capture anything are by default "parametric"
  closures: they can have parameters and they can be used as parameter values.
  To restore the previous behavior for capturing closures, "parametric,
  capture-by-unsafe-reference closures", tag the nested function with the
  `@parameter` decorator.

- üì¢ Mojo now has full support for "runtime" closures: nested functions that
  capture state materialized as runtime values. This includes taking the address
  of functions, indirect calls, and passing closures around through function
  arguments. Note that capture-by-reference is still unsafe!

  You can also take references to member functions with instances of that class
  using `foo.member_function`, which creates a closure with `foo` bound to the
  `self` argument.

- üì¢ Mojo now supports Python style `with` statements and context managers.

  These things are very helpful for implementing things like our
  trace region support and things like Runtime support.

  A context manager in Mojo implements three methods:

  ```mojo
  fn __enter__(self) -> T:
  fn __exit__(self):
  fn __exit__(self, err: Error) -> Bool:
  ```

  The first is invoked when the context is entered, and returns a
  value that may optionally be bound to a target for use in the with
  body. If the with block exits normally, the second method is
  invoked to clean it up. If an error is raised, the third method
  is invoked with the Error value. If that method returns true, the
  error is considered handled, if it returns false, the error is
  re-thrown so propagation continues out of the 'with' block.

- üì¢ Mojo functions now support variable scopes! Explicit `var` and `let`
  declarations inside functions can shadow declarations from higher "scopes",
  where a scope is defined as any new indentation block. In addition, the
  `for` loop iteration variable is now scoped to the loop body, so it is
  finally possible to write

  ```mojo
  for i in range(1): pass
  for i in range(2): pass
  ```

- üì¢ Mojo now supports an `@value` decorator on structs to reduce boilerplate
  and encourage best practices in value semantics.  The `@value` decorator looks
  to see the struct has a memberwise initializer (which has arguments for each
  field of the struct), a `__copyinit__` method, and a `__moveinit__` method,
  and synthesizes the missing ones if possible.  For example, if you write:

  ```mojo
  @value
  struct MyPet:
    var name: String
    var age: Int
  ```

  The `@value` decorator will synthesize the following members for you:

  ```mojo
  fn __init__(inout self, owned name: String, age: Int):
      self.name = name^
      self.age = age
  fn __copyinit__(inout self, existing: Self):
      self.name = existing.name
      self.age = existing.age
  fn __moveinit__(inout self, owned existing: Self):
      self.name = existing.name^
      self.age = existing.age
  ```

  This decorator can greatly reduce the boilerplate needed to define common
  aggregates, and gives you best practices in ownership management
  automatically.  The `@value` decorator can be used with types that need custom
  copy constructors (your definition wins).  We can explore having the decorator
  take arguments to further customize its behavior in the future.

- üìö Memcpy and memcmp now consistently use count as the byte count.

- üìö Add a variadic sting join on strings.

- üìö Introduce a `reduce_bit_count` method to count the number of 1 across all
  elements in a SIMD vector.

- üìö Optimize the `pow` function if the exponent is integral.

- üìö Add a `len` function which dispatches to `__len__` across the different
  structs that support it.

### Week of 2023-04-17

- üì¢ Error messages have been significantly improved, thanks to prettier
  printing for Mojo types in diagnostics.

- üì¢ Variadic values can now be indexed directly without wrapping them in a
  `VariadicList`!

- üì¢ `let` declarations in a function can now be lazily initialized, and `var`
  declarations that are never mutated get a warning suggesting they be converted
  to a `let` declaration.  Lazy initialization allows more flexible patterns of
  initialization than requiring the initializer be inline, e.g.:

  ```mojo
  let x: Int
  if cond:
      x = foo()
  else:
      x = bar()
  use(x)
  ```

- üì¢ Functions defined with `def` now return `object` by default, instead of
  `None`. This means you can return values (convertible to `object`) inside
  `def` functions without specifying a return type.

- üì¢ The `@raises` decorator has been removed. Raising `fn` should be declared
  by specifying `raises` after the function argument list. The rationale is that
  `raises` is part of the type system, instead of a function modifier.

- üì¢ The `BoolLiteral` type has been removed. Mojo now emits `True` and `False`
  directly as `Bool`.

- üì¢ Syntax for function types has been added. You can now write function types
  with `fn(Int) -> String` or `async def(&String, *Int) -> None`. No more
  writing `!kgen.signature` types by hand!

- üì¢ Float literals are not emitted as `FloatLiteral` instead of an MLIR `f64`
  type!

- üì¢ Automatic destructors are now supported by Mojo types, currently spelled
  `fn __del___(owned self):` (the extra underscore will be dropped shortly).
  These destructors work like Python object destructors and similar to C++
  destructors, with the major difference being that they run "as soon as
  possible" after the last use of a value.  This means they are not suitable
  for use in C++-style RAII patterns (use the `with` statement for that, which
  is currently unsupported).

  These should be generally reliable for both memory-only and register-passable
  types, with the caveat that closures are known to _not_ capture values
  correctly.  Be very careful with interesting types in the vicinity of a
  closure!

- A new (extremely dangerous!) builtin function is available for low-level
  ownership muckery.  The `__get_address_as_owned_value(x)` builtin takes a
  low-level address value (of `!kgen.pointer` type) and returns an `owned` value
  for the memory that is pointed to.  This value is assumed live at the
  invocation of the builtin, but is "owned" so it needs to be consumed by the
  caller, otherwise it will be automatically destroyed.  This is an effective
  way to do a "placement delete" on a pointer.

  ```mojo
  # "Placement delete": destroy the initialized object begin pointed to.
  _ = __get_address_as_owned_value(somePointer.value)

  # Result value can be consumed by anything that takes it as an 'owned'
  # argument as well.
  consume(__get_address_as_owned_value(somePointer.value))
  ```

- Another magic operator, named `__get_address_as_uninit_lvalue(x)` joins
  the magic LValue operator family.  This operator projects a pointer to
  an LValue like `__get_address_as_lvalue(x)`.  The difference is that
  `__get_address_as_uninit_lvalue(x)` tells the compiler that the pointee is
  uninitialized on entry and initialized on exit, which means that you can use
  it as a "placement new" in C++ sense.  `__get_address_as_lvalue(x)` tells the
  compiler that the pointee is initialized already, so reassigning over it will
  run the destructor.

  ```mojo
  # "*Re*placement new": destroy the existing SomeHeavy value in the memory,
  # then initialize a new value into the slot.
  __get_address_as_lvalue(somePointer.value) = SomeHeavy(4, 5)

  # Ok to use an lvalue, convert to borrow etc.
  use(__get_address_as_lvalue(somePointer.value))

  # "Placement new": Initialize a new value into uninitialied memory.
  __get_address_as_uninit_lvalue(somePointer.value) = SomeHeavy(4, 5)

  # Error, cannot read from uninitialized memory.
  use(__get_address_as_uninit_lvalue(somePointer.value))
  ```

  Note that `__get_address_as_lvalue` assumes that there is already a value at
  the specified address, so the assignment above will run the `SomeHeavy`
  destructor (if any) before reassigning over the value.

- üì¢ Implement full support for `__moveinit__` (aka move constructors)

  This implements the ability for memory-only types to define two different
  types of move ctors if they'd like:

  1. `fn __moveinit__(inout self, owned existing: Self)`: Traditional Rust
      style moving constructors that shuffles data around while taking
      ownership of the source binding.
  2. `fn __moveinit__(inout self, inout existing: Self):`: C++ style "stealing"
     move constructors that can be used to take from an arbitrary LValue.

  This gives us great expressive capability (better than Rust/C++/Swift)
  and composes naturally into our lifetime tracking and value
  categorization system.

- The `__call__` method of a callable type has been relaxed to take `self` by
  borrow, allow non-copyable callees to be called.

- Implicit conversions are now invoked in `raise` statements properly, allowing
  converting strings to `Error` type.

- Automatic destructors are turned on for `__del__` instead of `__del___`.

- üìö Add the builtin FloatLiteral type.

- üìö Add integral `floordiv` and `mod` for the SIMD type that handle negative
  values.

- üìö Add an F64 to String converter.

- üìö Make the `print` function take variadic inputs.

### Week of 2023-04-10

- üì¢ Introduce consume operator `x^`

  This introduces the postfix consume operator, which produces an RValue given
  a lifetime tracked object (and, someday, a movable LValue).

- Mojo now automatically synthesizes empty destructor methods for certain types
  when needed.

- The `object` type has been built out into a fully-dynamic type, with dynamic
  function dispatch, with full error handling support.

  ```mojo
  def foo(a) -> object:
      return (a + 3.45) < [1, 2, 3] # raises a TypeError
  ```

- üì¢ The `@always_inline` decorator is no longer required for passing capturing
  closures as parameters, for both the functions themselves as functions with
  capturing closures in their parameters. These functions are still inlined but
  it is an implementation detail of capturing parameter closures. Mojo now
  distinguishes between capturing and non-capturing closures. Nested functions
  are capturing by default and can be made non-capturing with the
  `@noncapturing` decorator. A top-level function can be passed as a capturing
  closure by marking it with the `@closure` decorator.

- üì¢ Support for list literals has been added. List literals `[1, 2, 3]`
  generate a variadic heterogeneous list type.

- Variadics have been extended to work with memory-primary types.

- Slice syntax is now fully-supported with a new builtin `slice` object, added
  to the compiler builtins. Slice indexing with `a[1:2:3]` now emits calls to
  `__setitem__` and `__getitem__` with a slice object.

- Call syntax has been wired up to `__call__`. You can now `f()` on custom
  types!

- Closures are now explicitly typed as capturing or non-capturing. If a
  function intends to accept a capturing closure, it must specify the
  `capturing` function effect.

- üìö Add a `Tile2D` function to enable generic `2D` tiling optimizations.

- üìö Add the `slice` struct to enable getting/setting spans of elements via
  `getitem`/`setitem`.

- üìö Add syntax sugar to autotuning for both specifying the autotuned values,
  searching, and declaring the evaluation function.

### Week of 2023-04-03

- The `AnyType` and `NoneType` aliases were added and auto-imported in all
  files.

- üì¢ The Mojo VS Code extension has been improved with docstring validation. It
  will now warn when a function's docstring has a wrong argument name, for
  example.

- üì¢ A new built-in literal type `TupleLiteral` was added in `_CompilerBuiltin`.
  It represents literal tuple values such as `(1, 2.0)` or `()`.

- üì¢ The `Int` type has been moved to a new `Builtin` module and is
  auto-imported in all code. The type of integer literals has been changed from
  the MLIR `index` type to the `Int` type.

- Mojo now has a powerful flow-sensitive uninitialized variable checker.  This
  means that you need to initialize values before using them, even if you
  overwrite all subcomponents.  This enables the compiler to reason about the
  true lifetime of values, which is an important stepping stone to getting
  automatic value destruction in place.

- üì¢ Call syntax support has been added. Now you can directly call an object
  that implements the `__call__` method, like `foo(5)`.

- üì¢ The name for copy constructors got renamed from `__copy__` to
  `__copyinit__`.  Furthermore, non-`@register_passable` types now implement
  it like they do an init method where you fill in a by-reference self, for
  example:

  ```mojo
  fn __copyinit__(inout self, existing: Self):
      self.first = existing.first
      self.second = existing.second
  ```

  This makes copy construction work more similarly to initialization, and
  still keeps copies `x = y` distinct from initialization `x = T(y)`.

- üì¢ Initializers for memory-primary types are now required to be in the form
  `__init__(inout self, ...):` with a None result type, but for register primary
  types, it remains in the form `__init__(...) -> Self:`. The `T{}` initializer
  syntax has been removed for memory-primary types.

- Mojo String literals now emit a builtin `StringLiteral` type! One less MLIR
  type to worry about.

- New `__getattr__` and `__setattr__` dunder methods were added. Mojo calls
  these methods on a type when attempting member lookup of a non-static member.
  This allows writing dynamic objects like `x.foo()` where `foo` is not a member
  of `x`.

- Early destructor support has been added. Types can now define a special
  destructor method `__del___` (note three underscores). This is an early
  feature and it is still being built out. There are many caveats, bugs,
  and missing pieces. Stay tuned!

- üìö Integer division and mod have been corrected for rounding in the presence
  of negative numbers.

- üìö Add scalar types (UI8, SI32, F32, F64, etc.) which are aliases to
  `SIMD[1, type]`.

## March 2023

### Week of 2023-03-27

- üì¢ Parameter names are no longer load-bearing in function signatures. This
   gives more flexibility in defining higher-order functions, because the
   functions passed as parameters do not need their parameter names to match.

   ```mojo
   # Define a higher-order function...
   fn generator[
      func: __mlir_type[`!kgen.signature<`, Int, `>() -> !kgen.none`]
   ]():
      pass

   # Int parameter is named "foo".
   fn f0[foo: Int]():
      pass

   # Int parameter is named "bar".
   fn f1[bar: Int]():
      pass

   fn main():
      # Both can be used as `func`!
      generator[f0]()
      generator[f1]()
   ```

   Stay tuned for improved function type syntax...

- üì¢ Two magic operators, named `__get_lvalue_as_address(x)` and
  `__get_address_as_lvalue` convert stored LValues to and from `!kgen.pointer`
  types (respectively).  This is most useful when using the `Pointer[T]`
  library type.  The `Pointer.address_of(lvalue)` method uses the first one
  internally.  The second one must currently be used explicitly, and can be
  used to project a pointer to a reference that you can pass around and use
  as a self value, for example:

  ```mojo
  # "Replacement new" SomeHeavy value into the memory pointed to by a
  # Pointer[SomeHeavy].
  __get_address_as_lvalue(somePointer.value) = SomeHeavy(4, 5)
  ```

  Note that `__get_address_as_lvalue` assumes that there is already a value at
  the specified address, so the assignment above will run the `SomeHeavy`
  destructor (if any) before reassigning over the value.

- The `(((x)))` syntax is __mlir_op has been removed in favor of
  `__get_lvalue_as_address` which solves the same problem and is more general.

- üì¢ When using a mutable `self` argument to a struct `__init__` method, it
  now must be declared with `&`, like any other mutable method.  This clarifies
  the mutation model by making `__init__` consistent with other mutating
  methods.

- üìö Add variadic string join function.

- üìö Default initialize values with 0 or null if possible.

- üìö Add compressed, aligned, and mask store intrinsics.

### Week of 2023-03-20

- Initial `String` type is added to the standard library with some very basic
  methods.

- Add `DimList` to remove the need to use an MLIR list type throughout the
  standard library.

- üì¢ The `__clone__` method for copying a value is now named `__copy__` to
  better follow Python term of art.

- üì¢ The `__copy__` method now takes its self argument as a "borrowed" value,
  instead of taking it by reference.  This makes it easier to write, works for
  `@register_passable` types, and exposes more optimization opportunities to
  the early optimizer and dataflow analysis passes.

  ```mojo
  # Before:
  fn __clone__(inout self) -> Self: ...

  # After:
  fn __copy__(self) -> Self: ...
  ```

- üì¢ A new `@register_passable("trivial")` may be applied to structs that
  have no need for a custom `__copy__` or `__del__` method, and whose state is
  only made up of `@register_passable("trivial")` types.  This eliminates the
  need to define `__copy__` boilerplate and reduces the amount of IR generated
  by the compiler for trivial types like `Int`.

- You can now write back to attributes of structs that are produced by a
  computed lvalue expression.  For example `a[i].x = ..` works when `a[i]`
  is produced with a `__getitem__`/`__setitem__` call.  This is implemented by
  performing a read of `a[i]`, updating the temporary, then doing a writeback.

- The remaining hurdles to using non-parametric, `@register_passable` types as
  parameter values have been cleared. Types like `Int` should enjoy full use as
  parameter values.

- Parameter pack inference has been added to function calls. Calls to functions
  with parameter packs can now elide the pack types:

  ```mojo
  fn foo[*Ts: AnyType](*args: *Ts): pass

  foo(1, 1.2, True, "hello")
  ```

  Note that the syntax for parameter packs has been changed as well.

- üìö Add the runtime string type.

- üìö Introduce the DimList struct to remove the need to use low-level MLIR
  operations.

### Week of 2023-03-13

- üì¢ Initializers for structs now use `__init__` instead of `__new__`,
  following standard practice in Python.  You can write them in one of two
  styles, either traditional where you mutate self:

  ```mojo
  fn __init__(self, x: Int):
      self.x = x
  ```

  or as a function that returns an instance:

  ```mojo
  fn __init__(x: Int) -> Self:
      return Self {x: x}
  ```

  Note that `@register_passable` types must use the later style.

- üì¢ The default argument convention is now the `borrowed` convention.  A
  "borrowed" argument is passed like a C++ `const&` so it doesn't need to
  invoke the copy constructor (aka the `__clone__` method) when passing a value
  to the function.  There are two differences from C++ `const&`:

  1. A future borrow checker will make sure there are no mutable
     aliases with an immutable borrow.
  2. `@register_passable` values are passed directly in an SSA register (and
     thus, usually in a machine register) instead of using an extra reference
     wrapper.  This is more efficient and is the 'right default' for
     `@register_passable` values like integers and pointers.

  This also paves the way to remove the reference requirement from `__clone__`
  method arguments, which will allow us to fill in more support for them.

- Support for variadic pack arguments has been added to Mojo. You can now
  write heterogeneous variadic packs like:

  ```mojo
  fn foo[*Ts: AnyType](args*: Ts): pass

  foo[Int, F32, String, Bool](1, 1.5, "hello", True)
  ```

- The `owned` argument convention has been added. This argument convention
  indicates that the function takes ownership of the argument and is responsible
  for managing its lifetime.

- The `borrowed` argument convention has been added. This convention signifies
  the callee gets an immutable shared reference to a value in the caller's
  context.

- üìö Add the `getenv` function to the `OS` module to enable getting environment
  variables.

- üìö Enable the use of dynamic strides in `NDBuffer`.

### Week of 2023-03-06

- üì¢ Support added for using capturing async functions as parameters.

- üì¢ Returning result parameters has been moved from `return` statements to a
  new `param_return` statement. This allows returning result parameters from
  throwing functions:

  ```mojo
  @raises
  fn foo[() -> out: Int]():
      param_return[42]
      raise Error()
  ```

  And returning different parameters along `@parameter if` branches:

  ```mojo
  fn bar[in: Bool -> out: Int]():
      @parameter
      if in:
          param_return[1]
      else:
          param_return[2]
  ```

- üì¢ Mojo now supports omitting returns at the end of functions when they would
  not reachable. For instance,

  ```mojo
  fn foo(cond: Bool) -> Int:
      if cond:
          return 0
      else:
          return 1

  fn bar() -> Int:
      while True:
          pass
  ```

- String literals now support concatenation, so `"hello " "world"` is treated
  the same as `"hello world"`.

- Empty bodies on functions, structs, and control flow statements are no longer
  allowed.  Please use `pass` in them to explicitly mark that they are empty,
  just like in Python.

- üì¢ Structs in Mojo now default to living in memory instead of being passed
  around in registers.  This is the right default for generality (large
  structures, structures whose pointer identity matters, etc) and is a key
  technology that enables the borrow model.  For simple types like `Int` and
  `SIMD`, they can be marked as `@register_passable`.

  Note that memory-only types currently have some limitations: they cannot be
  used in generic algorithms that take and return a `!mlirtype` argument, and
  they cannot be used in parameter expressions.  Because of this, a lot of
  types have to be marked `@register_passable` just to work around the
  limitations.  We expect to enable these use-cases over time.

- üì¢ Mojo now supports computed lvalues, which means you can finally assign to
  subscript expressions instead of having to call `__setitem__` explicitly.

  Some details on this: Mojo allows you to define multiple `__setitem__`
  overloads, but will pick the one that matches your `__getitem__` type if
  present.  It allows you to pass computed lvalues into inout arguments by
  introducing a temporary copy of the value in question.

- Mojo now has much better support for using register-primary struct types in
  parameter expressions and as the types of parameter values. This will allow
  migration of many standard library types away from using bare MLIR types like
  `__mlir_type.index` and towards using `Int`. This moves us towards getting rid
  of MLIR types everywhere and makes struct types first-class citizens in the
  parameter system.

- üìö Add a `sort` function.

- üìö Add non-temporal store to enable cache bypass.

## February 2023

### Week of 2023-02-27

- üì¢ The `@interface`, `@implements`, and `@evaluator` trio of decorators have
  been removed, replaced by the `@parameter if` and `@adaptive` features.

- üì¢ Parameter inference can now infer the type of variadic lists.

- üì¢ Memory primary types are now supported in function results. A result slot
  is allocated in the caller, and the callee writes the result of the function
  into that slow. This is more efficient for large types that don't fit into
  registers neatly! And initializers for memory-primary types now initialize
  the value in-place, instead of emitting a copy!

- Support for `let` decls of memory primary types has been implemented. These
  are constant, ready-only values of memory primary types but which are
  allocated on the function stack.

- Overload conversion resolution and parameter inference has been improved:

  1. Inference now works with `let` decls in some scenarios that weren't
     working before.
  2. Parameter bindings can now infer types into parameter expressions. This
     helps resolve higher-order functions in parameter expressions.

- üìö Optimize floor, ceil, and ldexp on X86 hardware.

- üìö Implement the log math function.

### Week of 2023-02-20

- üì¢ A new `@__memory_primary` struct decorator has been introduced. Memory
  primary types must always have an address. For instance, they are always
  stack-allocated when declared in a function and their values are passed into
  function calls by address instead of copy. This is in contract with register
  primary types that may not have an address, and which are passed by value
  in function calls. Memory-primary fields are not allowed inside
  register-primary structs, because struct elements are stored in-line.

- üì¢ A new `_CompilerBuiltin` module was added. This module defines core types
  and functions of the language that are referenced by the parser, and hence, is
  auto-imported by all other modules. For example new types for literal values
  like the boolean True/False will be included in `_CompilerBuiltin`.

- üì¢ A special `__adaptive_set` property can be accessed on a function reference
  marked as `@adaptive`. The property returns the adaptive overload set of that
  function. The return type is a `!kgen.variadic`. This feature is useful to
  implement a generic `evaluate` function in the standard library.

- üì¢ A new built-in literal type `BoolLiteral` was added in `_CompilerBuiltin`.
  It represents the literal boolean values `True` and `False`. This is the first
  Mojo literal to be emitted as a standard library type!

- üìö Add the prefetch intrinsic to enable HW prefetching a cache line.

- üìö Add the InlinedFixedVector, which is optimized for small vectors and stores
  values on both the stack and the heap.

### Week of 2023-02-13

- Unqualified lookups of struct members apply contextual parameters. This means
  for instance that you can refer to static methods without binding the
  struct parameters.

  ```mojo
  struct Foo[x: Int]:
      @staticmethod
      bar(): pass

      foo(self):
          bar()         # implicitly binds to Foo[x].bar()
          Foo[2].bar()  # explicitly bind to another parameter
  ```

- üì¢ A new `Self` type refers to the enclosing type with all parameters bound
  to their current values.  This is useful when working with complex parametric
  types, e.g.:

  ```mojo
  struct MyArray[size: Int, element_type: type]:
     fn __new__() -> Self:
         return Self {...}
  ```

  which is a lot nicer than having to say `MyArray[size, element_type]` over
  and over again.

- üì¢ Mojo now supports an `@adaptive` decorator. This decorator will supersede
  interfaces, and it represents an overloaded function that is allowed to
  resolve to multiple valid candidates. In that case, the call is emitted as a
  fork, resulting in multiple function candidates to search over.

  ```mojo
  @adaptive
  fn sort(arr: ArraySlice[Int]):
      bubble_sort(arr)

  @adaptive
  fn sort(arr: ArraySlice[Int]):
      merge_sort(arr)

  fn concat_and_sort(lhs: ArraySlice[Int], rhs: ArraySlice[Int]):
      let arr = lhs + rhs
      sort(arr) # this forks compilation, creating two instances
                # of the surrounding function
  ```

- üì¢ Mojo now requires that types implement the `__clone__` special member in
  order to copy them.  This allows the safe definition of non-copyable types
  like Atomic.  Note that Mojo still doesn't implement destructors, and (due to
  the absence of non-mutable references) it doesn't actually invoke the
  `__clone__` member when copying a let value. As such, this forces to you as
  a Mojo user to write maximal boilerplate without getting much value out of it.

  In the future, we will reduce the boilerplate with decorators, and we will
  actually start using it. This will take some time to build out though.

- üì¢ A special `__mlir_region` statement was added to provide stronger
  invariants around defining MLIR operation regions in Mojo. It similar syntax
  to function declarations, except it there are no results and no input
  conventions.

- üìö Implement the log math function.

- üìö Improve the DType struct to enable compile-time equality checks.

- üìö Add the Complex struct class.

### Week of 2023-02-06

- üì¢ The `if` statement now supports a `@parameter` decorator, which requires
  its condition to be a parameter expression, but which only emits the 'True'
  side of the condition to the binary, providing a "static if" functionality.
  This should eliminate many uses of `@interface` that are just used to provide
  different constraint on the implementations.

- üì¢ `fn main():` is now automatically exported and directly runnable by the
  command-line `mojo` tool. This is a stop-gap solution to enable script-like
  use cases until we have more of the language built out.

- ü™¶ The `@nodebug_inline` feature has been removed, please use
  `@alwaysinline("nodebug")` for methods that must be inlined and that we don't
  want to step into.

- üì¢ Python chained comparisons, ex. `a < b < c`, are now supported in Mojo.

- üì¢ Functions can now be defined with default argument values, such as
  `def f(x: Int, y: Int = 5):`. The default argument value is used when callers
  do not provide a value for that argument: `f(3)`, for example, uses the
  default argument value of `y = 5`.

- Unused coroutine results are now nicely diagnosed as "missing await" warnings.

- üìö Introduce a vectorized reduction operations to the SIMD type.

## January 2023

### Week of 2023-01-30

- A basic Mojo language server has been added to the VS Code extension, which
  parses your code as you write it, and provides warnings, errors, and fix-it
  suggestions!

- üíØ The Mojo standard library is now implicitly imported by default.

- The coroutine lowering support was reworked and a new `Coroutine[T]` type was
  implemented. Now, the result of a call to an async function MUST be wrapped in
  a `Coroutine[T]`, or else memory will leak. In the future, when Mojo supports
  destructors and library types as literal types, the results of async function
  calls will automatically wrapped in a `Coroutine[T]`. But today, it must be
  done manually. This type implements all the expected hooks, such as
  `__await__`, and `get()` to retrieve the result. Typical usage:

  ```mojo
  async fn add_three(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) -> Int:
      return a + b + c

  async fn call_it():
      let task: Coroutine[Int] = add_three(1, 2, 3)
      print(await task)
  ```

- ‚≠êÔ∏è We now diagnose unused expression values at statement context in `fn`
  declarations (but not in `def`s). This catches bugs with unused values, e.g.
  when you forget the parens to call a function.

- üì¢ An `@always_inline("nodebug")` function decorator can be used on functions
  that need to be force inlined, but when they should not have debug info in
  the result.  This should be used on methods like `Int.__add__` which should
  be treated as builtin.

- üì¢ The `@export` decorator now supports an explicit symbol name to export to,
  for example:

  ```mojo
  @export("baz") # exported as 'baz'
  fn some_mojo_fn_name():
  ```

- üì¢ üöß Subscript syntax is now wired up to the `__getitem__` dunder method.

  This allows type authors to implement the `__getitem__` method to enable
  values to be subscripted.  This is an extended version of the Python semantics
  (given we support overloading) that allows you to define N indices instead of
  a single version that takes a tuple (also convenient because we don't have
  tuples yet).

  Note that this has a very, very important limitation: subscripts are NOT
  wired up to `__setitem__` yet. This means that you can read values with
  `.. = v[i]` but you cannot store to them with `v[i] = ..`.  For this, please
  continue to call `__setitem__` directly.

- üì¢ Function calls support parameter inference.

  For calls to functions that have an insufficient number of parameters
  specified at the callsite, we can now infer them from the argument list. We
  do this by matching up the parallel type structure to infer what the
  parameters must be.

  Note that this works left to right in the parameter list, applying explicitly
  specified parameters before trying to infer new ones. This is similar to how
  C++ does things, which means that you may want to reorder the list of
  parameters with this in mind. For example, a `dyn_cast`-like function will be
  more elegant when implemented as:

  `fn dyn_cast[DstType: type, SrcType: type](src: SrcType) -> DstType:`

  Than with the `SrcType`/`DstType` parameters flipped around.

- üìö Add the growable Dynamic vector struct.

### Week of 2023-01-23

- Inplace operations like `+=`/`__iadd__` may now take `self` by-val if they
  want to, instead of requiring it to be by-ref.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Inplace operations are no longer allowed to return a non-None value.  The
  corresponding syntax is a statement, not an expression.

- A new `TaskGroup` type was added to the standard library. This type can be
  used to schedule multiple tasks on a multi-threaded workqueue to be executed
  in parallel. An async function can `await` all the tasks at once with the
  taskgroup.

- üì¢ We now support for loops! A type that defines an `__iter__` method that
  returns a type that defines `__next__` and `__len__` methods is eligible to
  be used in the statement `for el in X()`. Control flow exits the loop when
  the length is zero.

  This means things like this now work:

  ```mojo
  for item in range(start, end, step):
      print(item)
  ```

- Result parameters now have names. This is useful for referring to result
  parameters in the return types of a function:

  ```mojo
  fn return_simd[() -> nelts: Int]() -> SIMD[f32, nelts]:
  ```

- üì¢ We now support homogeneous variadics in value argument lists, using the
  standard Python `fn thing(*args: Int):` syntax! Variadics also have support
  in parameter lists:

  ```mojo
  fn variadic_params_and_args[*a: Int](*b: Int):
      print(a[0])
      print(b[1])
  ```

- üìö Add the range struct to enable `for ... range(...)` loops.

- üìö Introduce the unroll generator to allow one to unroll loops via a library
  function.

### Week of 2023-01-16

- üì¢ Struct field references are now supported in parameter context, so you
    can use `someInt.value` to get the underlying MLIR thing out of it. This
    should allow using first-class types in parameters more widely.
- üì¢ We now support "pretty" initialization syntax for structs, e.g.:

  ```mojo
  struct Int:
      var value: __mlir_type.index
      fn __new__(value: __mlir_type.index) -> Int:
          return Int {value: value}
  ```

  This eliminates the need to directly use the MLIR `lit.struct.create` op in
  struct initializers.  This syntax may change in the future when ownership
  comes in, because we will be able to support the standard `__init__` model
  then.
- üì¢ It is now possible to attach regions to `__mlir_op` operations.  This is
  done with a hack that allows an optional `_region` attribute that lists
  references to the region bodies (max 1 region right now due to lack of list
  `[]` literal).
- Nested functions now parse, e.g.:

  ```mojo
  fn foo():
      fn bar():
          pass
      bar()
  ```

- Python-style `async` functions should now work and the `await` expression
  prefix is now supported.  This provides the joy of async/await syntactic
  sugar when working with asynchronous functions.  This is still somewhat
  dangerous to use because we don't have proper memory ownership support yet.

- String literals are now supported.

- Return processing is now handled by a dataflow pass inside the compiler, so
  it is possible to return early out of if statements.

- The parser now supports generating 'fixit' hints on diagnostics, and uses
  them when a dictionary literal uses a colon instead of equal, e.g.:

  ```log
  x.mojo:8:48: error: expected ':' in subscript slice, not '='
      return __mlir_op.`lit.struct.create`[value = 42]()
                                                 ^
                                                 :
  ```

- üìö Add reduction methods which operate on buffers.

- üìö Add more math functions like sigmoid, sqrt, rsqrt, etc.

- üìö Add partial load / store which enable loads and stores that are predicated
  on a condition.

### Week of 2023-01-09

- The `/` and `*` markers in function signatures are now parsed and their
  invariants are checked.  We do not yet support keyword arguments yet though,
  so they aren't very useful.
- Functions now support a new `@nodebug_inline` decorator.
  (Historical note: this was later replaced with `@alwaysinline("nodebug")`).

  Many of the things at the bottom level of the Mojo stack are trivial
  zero-abstraction wrappers around MLIR things, for example, the `+`
  operator on Int or the `__bool__` method on Bool itself.  These operators
  need to be force inlined even at -O0, but they have some additional things
  that we need to wrestle with:

  1. In no case would a user actually want to step into the `__bool__` method on
     Bool or the + method on Int.  This would be terrible debugger QoI for
     unless you're debugging Int itself. We need something like
     `__always_inline__, __nodebug__` attributes that clang uses in headers
     like xmmintrin.h.

  2. Similarly, these "operators" should be treated by users as primitives:
     they don't want to know about MLIR or internal implementation details of
     Int.

  3. These trivial zero abstraction things should be eliminated early in the
     compiler pipeline so they don't slow down the compiler, bloating out the
     call graph with trivial leaves.  Such thing slows down the elaborator,
     interferes with basic MLIR things like fold(), bloats out the IR, or
     bloats out generated debug info.

  4. In a parameter context, we want some of these things to get inlined so
     they can be simplified by the attribute logic and play more nicely with
     canonical types.  This is just a nice to have thing those of us who have
     to stare at generated IR.

  The solution to this is a new `@nodebug_inline` decorator. This decorator
  causes the parser to force-inline the callee instead of generating a call to
  it. While doing so, it gives the operations the location of the call itself
  (that's the "nodebug" part) and strips out let decls that were part of the
  internal implementation details.

  This is a super-power-user-feature intended for those building the standard
  library itself, so it is intentionally limited in power and scope: It can
  only be used on small functions, it doesn't support regions, by-ref, throws,
  async, etc.

- Separately, we now support an `@alwaysInline` decorator on functions. This
  is a general decorator that works on any function, and indicates that the
  function must be inlined. Unlike `@nodebug_inline`, this kind of inlining is
  performed later in the compilation pipeline.

- The `__include` hack has been removed now that we have proper import support.

- `__mlir_op` can now get address of l-value:

  You can use magic `(((x)))` syntax in __mlir_op that forces the `x`
  expression to be an lvalue, and yields its address.  This provides an escape
  hatch (isolated off in `__mlir_op` land) that allows unsafe access to lvalue
  addresses.

- We now support `__rlshift__` and `__rtruediv__`.

- üì¢ The parser now resolves scoped alias references.  This allows us to support
  things like `SomeType.someAlias`, forward substituting the value.  This
  unblocks use of aliases in types like `DType`.  We'd like to eventually
  preserve the reference in the AST, but this unblocks library development.

- üìö Add a `now` function and `Benchmark` struct to enable timing and
  benchmarking.

- üìö Move more of the computation in NDBuffer from runtime to compile time if
  possible (e.g. when the dimensions are known at compile time).

### Week of 2023-01-02

- üìö Added the `print` function which works on Integers and SIMD values.

- The frontend now has a new diagnostic subsystem used by the `kgen` tool (but
  not by `kgen-translate` for tests) that supports source ranges on
  diagnostics. Before we'd emit an error like:

  ```log
  x.mojo:13:3: error: invalid call to 'callee': in argument #0, value of type '$F32::F32' cannot be converted to expected type '$int::Int'
    callee(1.0+F32(2.0))
    ^
  x.lit:4:1: note: function declared here
  fn callee(a: Int):
  ^
  ```

   now we produce:

  ```log
  x.mojo:13:3: error: invalid call to 'callee': in argument #0, value of type '$F32::F32' cannot be converted to expected type '$int::Int'
    callee(1.0+F32(2.0))
    ^      ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  x.lit:4:1: note: function declared here
  fn callee(a: Int):
  ^
  ```

- üì¢ Parameter results are now supported in a proper way. They are now forward
  declared with an alias declaration and then bound in a call with an arrow,
  e.g.:

  ```mojo
  alias a: __mlir_type.index
  alias b: __mlir_type.index
  idx_result_params[xyz * 2 -> a, b]()
  ```

- Various minor issues with implicit conversions are fixed. For instances,
  implicit conversions are now supported in parameter binding contexts and
  `alias` declarations with explicit types.
- Doc strings are allowed on functions and structs, but they are currently
  discarded by the parser.

- üìö Add a `print` method!!!

- üìö Demonstrate a naive matmul in Mojo.

- üìö Initial work on functions that depend on types (e.g. FPUtils, nan, inf,
  etc.)

- üìö Allow one to query hardware properties such as simd_width, os, etc. via
  TargetInfo at compile time.

## December 2022

### Week of 2022-12-26

- üì¢ You can now call functions in a parameter context! Calling a function in
  a parameter context will evaluate the function at compile time. The result
  can then be used as parameter values. For example,

  ```mojo
  fn fma(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int) -> Int:
      return a + b * c

  fn parameter_call():
      alias nelts = fma(32, 2, 16)
      var x: SIMD[f32, nelts]
  ```

- You can now disable printing of types in an `__mlir_attr` substitution by
   using unary `+` expression.

- üì¢ `let` declarations are now supported in functions.  `let` declarations are
  local run-time constant values, which are always rvalues. They complement
  'var' decls (which are mutable lvalues) and are the normal thing to use in
  most cases.  They also generate less IR and are always in SSA form when
  initialized.

  We will want to extend this to support 'let' decls in structs at some point
  and support lazy initialized 'let' declarations (using dataflow analysis) but
  that isn't supported yet.

- üìö Add the NDBuffer struct.

- Happy new year.

### Week of 2022-12-19

- üìö Start of the Standard library:
  1. Added Integer and SIMD structs to bootstrap the standard library.
  2. Added very basic buffer data structure.

- We have basic support for parsing parameter results in function calls! Result
  parameters are an important Mojo metaprogramming feature. They allow functions
  to return compile-time constants.

  ```mojo
  fn get_preferred_simdwidthof[() -> nelts: Int]():
      return[2]

  fn vectorized_function():
      get_preferred_simdwidthof[() -> nelts]()
      var x: SIMD[f32, nelts]
  ```

- Types can now be used as parameters of `!kgen.mlirtype` in many more cases.

- MLIR operations with zero results don't need to specify `_type: []` anymore.

- We support parsing triple quoted strings, for writing docstrings for your
  functions and structs!

- A new `__mlir_type[a,b,c]` syntax is available for substituting into MLIR
   types and attributes is available, and the old placeholder approach is
   removed.  This approach has a few advantages beyond what placeholders do:

  1. It's simpler.
  2. It doesn't form the intermediate result with placeholders, which
     gets rejected by MLIR's semantic analysis, e.g. the complex case
     couldn't be expressed before.
  3. It provides a simple way to break long attrs/types across multiple
     lines.

- We now support an `@evaluator` decorator on functions for KGEN evaluators.
  This enables specifying user-defined interface evaluators when performing
  search during compilation.

- üì¢ `import` syntax is now supported!

  This handles packaging imported modules into file ops, enables effective
  isolation from the other decls. "import" into the desired context is just
  aliasing decls, with the proper symbols references handle automatically during
  IR generation. As a starting point, this doesn't handle any notion of packages
  (as those haven't been sketched out enough).

- üì¢ Reversed binary operators (like `__radd__`) are now looked up and used if
  the forward version (like `__add__`) doesn't work for some reason.

- üì¢ Implicit conversions are now generally available, e.g. in assign
  statements, variable initializers etc. There are probably a few more places
  they should work, but we can start eliminating all the extraneous explicit
  casts from literals now.

- Happy Holidays

### Week of 2022-12-12

- üì¢ Function overloading now works. Call resolution filters candidate list
  according to the actual parameter and value argument specified at the site of
  the call, diagnosing an error if none of the candidates are viable or if
  multiple are viable and ambiguous. We also consider implicit conversions in
  overload look:

  ```mojo
  fn foo(x: Int): pass
  fn foo(x: F64): pass

  foo(Int(1)) # resolves to the first overload
  foo(1.0)    # resolves to the second overload
  foo(1)      # error: both candidates viable with 1 implicit conversion!
  ```

- The short circuiting binary `and` and `or` expressions are now supported.

- Unary operator processing is a lot more robust, now handling the `not`
  expression and `~x` on Bool.

- üì¢ The compiler now generates debug information for use with GDB/LLDB that
  describes variables and functions.

- The first version of the Mojo Visual Studio Code extension has been released!
  It supports syntax highlighting for Mojo files.

- The first version of the `Bool` type has landed in the new Mojo standard
  library!

- üì¢ Implicit conversions are now supported in return statements.

### Week of 2022-12-05

- "Discard" patterns are now supported, e.g. `_ = foo()`

- We now support implicit conversions in function call arguments, e.g.
   converting an `index` value to `Int` automatically.  This eliminates a bunch
   of casts, e.g. the need to say F32(1.0) everywhere.

   This is limited for a few reasons that will be improved later:
   1. We don't support overloading, so lots of types aren't convertible
      from all the things they should be, e.g. you can't pass "1" to
      something that expects F32, because F32 can't be created from index.
   2. This doesn't "check to see if we can invoke `__new__`" it force applies
      it on a mismatch, which leads to poor QoI.
   3. This doesn't fix things that need radd.

## November 2022

### Week of 2022-11-28

- üì¢ We support the `True` and `False` keywords as expressions.

- üì¢ A new `alias` declaration is supported which allows defining local
   parameter values.  This will eventually subsume type aliases and other
   things as it gets built out.

- üì¢ We now have end-to-end execution of Mojo files using the `kgen` tool!
  Functions exported with `@export` can be executed.

- üì¢ We have try-except-else and `raise` statements and implicit error
  propagation! The error semantics are that `def` can raise by default, but `fn`
  must explicitly declare raising with a `@raises` decorator. Stub out basic
  `Error` type.

- The `&` sigil for by-ref arguments is now specified after the identifier.
  Postfix works better for ref and move operators on the expression
  side because it chains an mentally associates correctly:
  `thing.method().result^`. We don't do that yet, but align param
  decl syntax to it so that things won't be odd looking when we do.
  In practice this looks like:

  ```mojo
  def mutate_argument(a&: index):
      a = 25
  ```

### Week of 2022-11-21

- üì¢ The magic `index` type is gone. Long live `__mlir_type.index`.

- Implement parameter substitution into parametric `__mlir_type` decls. This
  allows us to define parametric opaque MLIR types with exposed parameters using
  a new "placeholder" attribute.  This allows us to expose the power of the KGEN
  type parametric system directly into Mojo.

- üì¢ Fully-parametric custom types can now be defined and work in Mojo, bringing
  together a lot of the recent work. We can write the SIMD type directly as a
  wrapper around the KGEN type, for example:

  ```mojo
  struct SIMD[dt: __mlir_type.`!kgen.dtype`, nelts: __mlir_type.index]:
      var value:
        __mlir_type.`!pop.simd<#lit<placeholder index>,
                               #lit<placeholder !kgen.dtype>>`[nelts, dt]

      fn __add__(self, rhs: SIMD[dt, nelts]) -> SIMD[dt, nelts]:
          return __mlir_op.`pop.add`(self.value, rhs.value)
  ```

### Week of 2022-11-14

- üì¢ Implement a magic `__mlir_type` declaration that can be used to access any
  MLIR type. E.g. `__mlir_type.f64`.

- üì¢ Add an `fn` declaration. These are like `def` declarations, but are more
  strict in a few ways: they require type annotations on arguments, don't allow
  implicit variable declarations in their body, and make their arguments rvalues
  instead of lvalues.

- Implemented Swift-style backtick identifiers, which are useful for code
  migration where names may collide with new keywords.

- üì¢ A new `__include` directive has been added that performs source-level
  textual includes. This is temporary until we have an `import` model.

- Implement IR generation for arithmetic operators like `+` and `*` in terms
  of the `__add__` and `__mul__` methods.

- üì¢ Added support for `break` and `continue` statements, as well as early
  returns inside loops and conditionals!

- üì¢ Implemented augmented assignment operators, like `+=` and `@=`.

- üì¢ Mojo now has access to generating any MLIR operations (without regions)
  with a new `__mlir_op` magic declaration. We can start to build out the
  language's builtin types with this:

  ```mojo
  struct Int:
      var value: __mlir_type.index

      fn __add__(self, rhs: Int) -> Int:
          return __mlir_op.`index.add`(self.value, rhs.value)
  ```

  Attributes can be attached to the declaration with subscript `[]` syntax,
  and an explicit result type can be specified with a special `_type` attribute
  if it cannot be inferred. Attributes can be accessed via the `__mlir_attr`
  magic decl:

  ```mojo
  __mlir_op.`index.cmp`[
      _type: __mlir_type.i1,
      pred: __mlir_attr.`#index<cmp_predicate slt>`
  ](lhs, rhs)
  ```

- Improved diagnostics emissions with ranges! Now errors highlight the whole
  section of code and not just the first character.

### Week of 2022-11-07

- Implemented the `@interface` and `@implements` decorators, which provide
  access to KGEN generator interfaces. A function marked as an `@interface`
  has no body, but it can be implemented by multiple other functions.

  ```mojo
  @interface
  def add(lhs: index, rhs: index):

  @implements(add)
  def normal_add(lhs: index, rhs: index) -> index:
      return lhs + rhs

  @implements(add)
  def slow_add(lhs: index, rhs: index) -> index:
      wait(1000)
      return normal_add(lhs, rhs)
  ```

- üì¢ Support for static struct methods and initializer syntax has been added.
  Initializing a struct with `Foo()` calls an implicitly static `__new__`
  method. This method should be used instead of `__init__` inside structs.

  ```mojo
  struct Foo:
      var value: index

      def __new__() -> Foo:
          var result: Foo
          result.value = Foo.return_a_number() # static method!
          return result

      @staticmethod
      def return_a_number() -> index:
          return 42
  ```

- üì¢ Full by-ref argument support. It's now possible to define in-place
  operators like `__iadd__` and functions like `swap(x, y)` correctly.

- üì¢ Implemented support for field extract from rvalues, like `x.value` where
  `x` is not an lvalue (`var` declaration or by-ref function argument).

## October 2022

### Week of 2022-10-31

- Revised `return` handling so that a return statement with no expression is
  syntax sugar for `return None`. This enables early exits in functions that
  implicitly return `None` to be cleaner:

  ```mojo
  def just_return():
      return
  ```

- Added support for parsing more expressions: if-else, bitwise operators,
  shift operators, comparisons, floor division, remainder, and matmul.

- üì¢ The type of the `self` argument can now be omitted on member methods.

### Week of 2022-10-24

- Added parser support for right-associativity and unary ops, like the power
  operator `a ** b ** c` and negation operator `-a`.

- Add support for `&expr` in Mojo, which allows denoting a by-ref argument in
  functions. This is required because the `self` type of a struct method is
  implicitly a pointer.

- Implemented support for parametric function declarations, such as:

  ```mojo
  struct SIMD[dt: DType, width: index]:
      fn struct_method(self: &SIMD[dt, width]):
          pass

  def fancy_add[dt: DType, width: index](
      lhs: SIMD[dt, width], rhs: SIMD[dt, width]) -> index:
    return width
  ```

### Week of 2022-10-17

- Added explicit variable declarations with `var`, for declaring variables both
  inside functions and structs, with support for type references. Added `index`
  as a temporary built-in type.

  ```mojo
  def foo(lhs: index, rhs: index) -> index:
      var result: index = lhs + rhs
      return result
  ```

- Implemented support for parsing struct declarations and references to type
  declarations in functions! In `def`, the type can be omitted to signal an
  object type.

  ```mojo
  struct Foo:
      var member: index

  def bar(x: Foo, obj) -> index:
      return x.member
  ```

- Implemented parser support for `if` statements and `while` loops!

  ```mojo
  def if_stmt(c: index, a: index, b: index) -> index:
      var result: index = 0
      if c:
          result = a
      else:
          result = b
      return result

  def while_stmt(init: index):
      while init > 1:
          init = init - 1
  ```

- Significantly improved error emission and handling, allowing the parser to
  emit multiple errors while parsing a file.

### Week of 2022-10-10

- Added support for parsing integer, float, and string literals.

- Implemented parser support for function input parameters and results. You can
  now write parametric functions like,

  ```mojo
  def foo[param: Int](arg: Int) -> Int:
      result = param + arg
      return result
  ```

### Week of 2022-10-03

- Added some basic parser scaffolding and initial parser productions, including
  trivial expressions and assignment parser productions.
- Implemented basic scope handling and function IR generation, with support for
  forward declarations. Simple functions like,

  ```mojo
  def foo(x: Int):
  ```

  Now parse! But all argument types are hard-coded to the MLIR `index` type.

- Added IR emission for simple arithmetic expressions on builtin types, like
  `x + y`.

## September 2022

### Week of 2022-09-26

- Mojo's first patch to add a lexer was Sep 27, 2022.

- Settled on `[]` for Mojo generics instead of `<>`. Square brackets are
  consistent with Python generics and don't have the less than ambiguity
  other languages have.
